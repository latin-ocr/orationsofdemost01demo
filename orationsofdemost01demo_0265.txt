ORATIONIX.

SECOND PHILIPPIC.

y HENEVER, O Men of Athens, the Αᾶε of Hosti-
lity committed by Philip, and his perpetual Violation

0f the Peace concluded· between υς, are mentioned in our De—
bates, I perceive our Orations appear to you perfeffly equitable

and filled with Sentiments of exceeding Moderation, (1) while

Although the Argument of this Ora-
tion be founded upon the Authority of
Dionysius, yet the Occasxon, upon which
Libanius imagines it was spoken, is not
unworthy of our Attention. It is be-
fides supported by Lucchefini, the most
judicious and learned of our Commen-
tators.

When Philip’s Election to a Seat in the
Council of Ampliic'tyons was confirmed,
he used every Art of Affibility and Hu-
manity to gain the Affeetion and Esteem
of all kthe Grecian Republica He had
acquited much military Glory in the Pho-
caean War, and a Charaeter of l’iety to-
wards the Gods by revenging the Sacri-
lege committed against Apollo, Thes:

eVCI‘y

he considered as the Foundations of the
Defign he had formed of being appoint-
ed Cornrnander in Chief against the Per-
fians, ancl Genera] of the Grecian Forces
by common Consent of all their States.
ln this Defign, which however he did
not yet openly decl'are, he sent Ambaffa-
dors to all the principal Cities of Goeece,
and among the rest to Athens, with Pro·
posals of Alfiance, and Assurances of
Friendship. Suspecting the Sincerity of
these Affuranccs, our Orator represents
him in general a perfidious violator of
all Treates, and in particular a danger-'
ons Enemy to the Liberty of Athens.
