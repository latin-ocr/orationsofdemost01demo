TorHEATHENIANS. 323

prus, to Dionyfius of Syracuse, and to all their Descendants. (3)
If you therefore can persuade the NationS‚ by whom either of
these, your Cifizens, were expelled, to restore their Dominions
to them, you shall then prevai] with us to restore to Teres and
Chersobleptes the Territories they once governed in Thrace. (4)
.But while you will not even deign to expostulate with the N a-
tionS, who have thus injurioussy treated your Citizens‚ shall

you raise any Commotions against us, and may we not with
Justice repel their Violence ?

MANv other Argume11tS, which we might with Reason urge
upon this Occafion‚ we choose rather to pass over in Silence,

However, we freely delare our Resolution to succour the Car-

dians,

( 3) Athens had arrived to such a Pitch
of Glory, that even Sovereigns thought
it an Honour to be inrolled among her
Citizens. Other Grecian Republics as-
sumed the same Grandeur. When the
Corinthian Ambaffadors congratulated
Alexander upon his Vi&ories‚ they offer-
ed him, as the noblest Reward >of his
Merit, the Freedom of Corinth. Alex-
ander received the Proposal with a Smile
of Contempt‚ when one rof the Ambas-
sadors Know, Sir, that Hercules
and you are 'the zm& Persam Corinth ever
distinguished in this Manner. The Prince
was softened·, treated the Ambaffadors
with every poffible Honour, and willingly

 

accepted a Title, which gave him Her-
cules for a F ellow-Citizen. TouRREu„

(4) Τῆυ Θράκην ὅσης Τήρης, ὅδε,
Mr. Tourreil transsates the Paffage‚ toute
l’etendue de pays, que Teres, ὅτε. and
then remarks from his own Transsation‚
certainly without sufficient Authority from
the original Text, that Philip treats his
Subject with Pleasantry and Irony; that
the Kingdoms of Teres and Chersobieptes
were not really of such Extent as to de-
serve an express and serious Mention.
Thus a regular and powerful Argument
is exchanged‚ by an unjust Transsation
for a triv 121, injudicious Ironv.
