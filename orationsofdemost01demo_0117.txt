DEMOSTHENES. 43
the Thebans always employed the Arcadians against the Lace⁴

daemonians, but the Lacedaemoniam, whenever they gained
them to their Party, engaged thern against this Republic. I
therefore think it ought to be considered with Attention‚ that
by your not receiving the Megalopolitans into your Protection, if
they should be totally destroyed, and their Country laid in Ru ins,
the Lacedaemonians may become dangeroussy formidable3 or
on the contrary, should they be able to preserve themselves and
their Dominions, as Accident8‚ beyond all Hope, will sometimes

happen, they will justly become firmer Allies to the Thebans·

q But if you receive them into your F riendship, they will be in-

· debted to you alone for their Preservation.

ΒΗΤ transferring from them to ourselves the' Confideration
of the Event‚ and the Computation of all future Dangem, let
us fix our Attention upon the Thebans and Lacedaemonians. If
the Thebans be conquered, as for our Interest they ought, yet
the Lacedaemonians cannot become too formidable, While they
have an Enemy, the Arcadian3 nearly bordering upon their
Frontiers ; or should the Thebans recover the Health and F irm—

ness of their State3 should they be happily preserved; should
they not totally fall, they will, however, be less able to injure

us, while the Arcadians are our Allies, and those Allies indebt-
ed to us for their Preservation.
