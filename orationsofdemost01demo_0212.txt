ORATIONS OF

is not fitting with Severity to enquire into the Con-du& of

others, unless you first punc‘tually discharge your own Duty.

But from whence, O Men of Atl‘iens, do you imagine it pro-

ceeds, that all your Commanders abandon those Expeditions‚

to which you send them, and find out others for themselves?

Q: ὅ) If Ι may· be permitted to speak ingenuoussy with Regarcl

to your Commanders, it is because in fighting for the Repub-

lic all Advantage3‚ for which the W'ar is carried on, are solely

yours. Were Amphipolis taken, you would instantly resume

(16) Chares, Admiral of the Athe-
nian Fleet, had been sent with a strong
Squadron to relieve Amphipolis, besieged
by Philip. But Chares sold himself, and
the Honour of his Family3 the Glory
of his Expedition‚ and the Interests of
his C ountry‚ to aPerfian Satrape. Lampsa-
cus and Sigreum were the Price of his Ava-
rice, his Cowardice andhis Treason. After-
wards, while Philip made himself Nlasterof
severity—five Ciues, Alliesand Confederates
of AthenS‚ her Admiral had engaged in
an ignominious, hut safe and profitable
NR'ar, against the Merchants of theAEgean
Seas-‚ and joining a national Fleet with
a Band of Pyrates turned Pyrate himself.
The People, in Shame and Indigna-tion,
command Antiochus instautly to sail and
find out this infamous AdmiraL and to
denounce to him in the W ords of their
Decree, The People of Atheus are asto-
mfhed, that Philip marchen< to Chelsonesns,

the

an Athenian Province, while thqy neither
know where their Admiral is retired‚ or
the Forces they sent under his command. It
may be necessary to quote this Decree ist
the Original φράζειν, ’ὅτι θαυμά-
ζειᾶ §isthoc o‘a-a'iv Ἀθηνάων, ἔι φίλιπ-

 

πος μὲν ἐπὶ Χερἑόννησσν τῆν Ἀθηναίων
πορεύεται, Ἀθηνᾶιοι δὲ εἰδὲ τᾶν ςρατηγδν
ἴσασιν, ab} τήν δύναμιν, ἥν ἐξέπεμψαν,
ἕπε ἐςῖν. Chares did not dare to meet
the People in their first Indignation. He
pleaded his Cause by OratorS, whom his
pillaging and plundering the AEgean Mer-
chants had enabled him to corrupt. He
then returned and was acquitted. We
shall only remark upon this History, how
near to Ruin must be that maritime State‚.
whose Admiral dares to be a Coward, or*
a Traytor‚ yet is promeled from the
Vengeance of his Country‚ by the Ad-
ministration, and the Ministers3 for such
were the Orators of Athens„
