UP o N all Accounts, therefore, itis your Interest not to aban-
don the Arcadians; or, if they should, perhaps, escape the

present Danger, let them not seem to be preserved by their own μ

proper Strength, nor by any other Allies, but you alone. For
myself, O Men of Athens, by the Gods, neither 'in my per-
sona] Affeefion, or Hatred to either Party, have I spoken, but,

what Ι truly judged most conducive to the Interests of the Re-
public. Let me then advise, let me persuade yon, never to
abandon the Megalopolitan8‚ nor indeed any other weaker State

to the rapacious Ambition of the more powerful.
