In FAVOUR of the MEGALOPOLITANS.

, ΟΤΗ Parnes, in my Judgement‚ OMen of Athens, ap-
’ pear to wander extremely from their proper Charaeter33
they, who patronize the Arcadians, and they, who support

the Lacedaemoniam.
these Nations, not like Citizens of this Republic, to which

For as if they came Ambaffadors from

they were sent, they mutually calumniate and accuse each
other. This indeed is the Behaviour of Ambaffadors 3 but
to speak upon Affairs of Importance‚ with a Regard only to
the public Good, and without the Violence of Faetion to

propofe the most salutary CounciIS, is the peculiar Charaeter
of

The Arcadians and Argives, after the the Balance of Power between Lacedae·

Battle of Leuctra, entered the Territo-
ries of the Lacedaemoniam, which, dur·
ing five hundred Years, had never seen
an Enemy, and even threatened to be-
siege Sparta. After being viftorious in
several less important Engagenients, they
were totally mmcd, and lost ten thou-
sand Men. Animated by their Vietory‚
the Lacedaemonians march into Arcadia,
lay waste the Country‚ and propose to
befiege Megalopoli-s. The Megalopo-
litans send Ambaffadors to Thebes and
Athens, to solicit Succours. It was the
political Interest of the Atheniens to hold

mon and Thebe33 to weaken the present
Strength of the latter, and to prevent
the first from recovering that formidable
Sovereignty she had once held over the
States of Greece. The Thebans had
turned ( rrchomenutm Thelpiae, and Pla-
taea. These Cities, if restored, would
be a strong Barrier against the Thebans3

and the Arcadians in general, particu- -

larly the Megalopolitans, if vigoroussy
supported by the Republic, would suf„
ficiently check the growing power of the
Lacedaemoniam.
