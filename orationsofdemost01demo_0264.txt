TheARGUME'NT.

H E Messeniam and Argives oppreffed and insulted by the Lacedae-

monians, who had assumed a kind of arbitrary Sovereignty over
them, solicited Philip's Protefhon. That Monarch, by his Influence over
the Amphictyon& obtains a Decree‚ that declared them independant‚ and
hereafter to be governed by their own Laws. Under Pretence of support-
ing this Decree and the Authority of the Amphi&yons, he marches a
Body of Troops into Peloponnesus. The Lacedaemonians are alarmed.
They send Ambaffadors to Athens to solicit Succours, and to propose an
Alliance for their mutual Safety‚ An Embass'y, sent by Philip at the same
Time, accuses Lacedaemon of Injustice and Tyranny; afferts the Inte-
grity of their Master‘s Intentions; his Right of supporting his Allies;
his Resolution to maintain the ‘Peace concluded with Athens, and his
particular Affection for her People. The Athenians are divided between
their Apprehenfions of Philip, and a just Concern for their own Safety‚
which directed them to support the Lacedaemonians. Our Orator en-
deavours to animate them by strong Representations of their own Dan-
ger 3 by Sentiments worthy of the ancient Dignity of the Republic 5 by
opposmg the specious Profeffions of Philip's Integrity to the general Evi-
dence of his past Affions, and the manifest Ambition of his present

Conduft.

This Oration was pronounced in the first Year of the hundred and

ninth Olympiad, when Demosthenes was seven and thirty Years of Age.
