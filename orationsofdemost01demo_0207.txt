THAT these Reports are truc, it is most manifest3 sor thos„-

very Persons, whom we have unanimoussy driven from hence,
as in fa& more abandoned than even Jugl-ers and hibunt-c-

banks; Callias, for Instanoe, the Keeper of our public Jail,

(12) and Men of his infamous

Charaffilem Mimics of Things

ridiculous3 Poets of obscene SongS, which they compose on

their Companions, for the Sake of laughing and being lauglicd
at ; these are the People‚ whom he loves; whom he harh evei·

round him.

Vices like these, however inconfiderable any one

may esteem them, as affecling his personal Reputation alone,

honoured by Tyranny or Inhumanity3
and, confidering the usual Carnage of
the Greci-an Bari-les, his Vi&0ries were
not of Blood. His Ainbition was in-
deed insatiable and boundless3 but he
harh left us, perhap3, the noblest Sen-
timent upon true Glory in all Antiquity.
When he was preffed to march to Athens
after the Battle of Cheronaea ; The Gods
forbid, that a Pdnce, who hath fought
οηζγ for Glory, fhould destroy the Temple
and ‘Ihiatre of Glory.

(12) Thucydides thus understands the
Word ὃημόσ-ιον; perhaps, as carcer in
the Latin Tongue‚ it may fignify a Fel-
low worthy of a Jail·, a Jail-bird. Suid-
as mentions an Athenian Player of this
Name, Callias, surnamed Schoenion, from
his Father's making Ropes of Reeds. He
wrote several Comedies, of which we have
some few Verses, preserved by different
Authors, which do not want Pleasantry.

Θαυματοποιᾶἶν, in the Line before this,
includes the whole Tribe of (ζου-ᾖπῶς,
Ροιῒιιηε·ῑ611(π5, Mountebanks, Rope-
Daue-ers, and Jugkrs, who imposed up-
on the Wonder of the People by Feats
of Dexterity and Strcngth. or the Im-
pudence of fore-telling future Events,
Of these, and every other Kind of Vil-
lains‚ Philip gathered together above two
thousand, and built a (ρἰ)γ for them,
which he called Ποινηξὸπολις, The City cf
Villains. They soon thrcw off the *In-
famy of this Title. Their Diffidence
of each other produced Laws for Se-
curity of Property. The Mischiefs aris-
ing from Injustice‚ Violence and Pcr-
fidy, convinced them of the Neceffits
of Honesty, and how useful the ln-
fluences of Religion. Thus private
Vices, in historical Fast, became pub-
lic Virtue.
