'Upon the Liberty of the R H O D IA N S.

N my opinion, O Men of AthenS, when you debate upon,

Affairs of such Importance‚ you should grant a general

Freedom of Speech to whoever proposes his Advice. (1) Not

Among all our different Forms of Go-
>verriment, there is not another so liable
to civil Diffentions‚ as the Republican.
Virtue is, in general, the Foundation
Principle of all Republics. But pure
Democracies, agitated by the violent and
numultuous Paffions of the People, are
exposed to Revolutions‚ Confusion, Anar-

the Superiority‚ drove out the Athenians
and received the Lacedaemonians. The
People, when this Oration was spoken,
were in Poffeffion of the Government,
but apprelienfive of the Power and In-
fluence of Artaxerxes and Artemifia, or
rather cruelly oppreffed by them, they
applied to the Athenians for Affistance
and Support.

ficulty in this Pafl‘age. The Laws of
Solon permitteti, or rather called upon
