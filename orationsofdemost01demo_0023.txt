Oppreffion, arose 'to affert the sacred, unalienable Rights of
Mankind. This Spirit diffused itfclf through 22ss the States of
Greece excepting Macedonia. T heir Tyrants, were dethroned
and driven into Exile. The Athenians particularly declared
Jupiter their sole Monarch, at the same Period‚ in which the
Jews grew weary of their Theocracy, and obstinately resolved
to be no longer governed by God. But through Greece in ge-
neral the very Narne of Monarchy was held in Horror and De-

testation. A republican Government was establissied in all their

⁷ Cities‚ though varied into different Forms according to the

Manners, Genius, and Chara&ers of their People. The first
Nations‚ who threw off the Yoke of Tyraxmy, entertained too
generous a Sense of F reedom‚ to suffer their N eighbours to con—

tinue in Slavery. They thought the Cause of Liberty was it-
self interested not to endure so dangerous and ignominious an

Example3 or perhaps that Enthufiasm, to which we naturally
abandon ourseives in the first Heat of a Revolution‚ engaged
them to offer their Affistance to whoever seemed determined to ’

aflert their own Independence.
