xxviii ὈΝ THE POLITICAL STATE

Colonies and Issands, whose Fleets would have enabled them
to oppose their Rivals. But this Nation of Philosophers gave
⁷Way to their Paffions, and indulged them With a dissionourable,
pernicious Malignity. Belides, when Pausanias, who under
their Claim of Sovereignty, still commanded the united Forces
of Greeee against the Perfian, grew insolent and oppreffive to

the Anies, they did not disavow this Abuse of their Authority.
His Condudt therefore was compared to the Justice of Aristides,

and the Affability of Cimon. Immediately the States of Greece,
excepting those of Peloponnesus, implored the Proteffion of:
Athens, and engaged themselves never to enter into a War‚ but

under her Command.

NoR did the Athenians regularly pursue their own Plan of
Sovereignty. They‘wasted their national Strength in foreign*-
Wars‚ from avvmn-glorious Ardour of chastifing, the. Perfiansx
for invading Greece. These Wars, it is confeffed, afforded'
them Vi&orie8, easily won, enrichedwith Spoils, and splendid
in Reputation- But these Vi&ories tempted them to negledt a
more formidable Enemy at Home, and-although it carried with-
it an Air of Grandem- to affert the Liberty of the GrecianCo-
lonies, yet it made their Alliance andProtedfion less neceffary
to those Colonies. Wehave already said, that Wars upon ther·
Continent of Afia could never be of found Politics.
