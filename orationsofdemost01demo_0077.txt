ION I.

'Upon RA1s1NG the SUPPLIES.

HEN our Orators, O Men of Athens, dwell upon the
Praises of your Ancestors, I confess they choose a Sub-

ject for their Oratory to you most grateful, yet of no Advan-

tage to the PersonS, whose Encomium they pronounce (1). ’
For attempting to speak of Aetions, whose Greatness is beyond
all Power of Language to express, they bear away, indeed, the

Reputation of Eloquence, but make the Virtues of your An—

cestors appear to their Audience less eminent, than they were be—

The Title of this Oration‚ in the Ori-
ginah ‘O περὶ τῶν συμμωριῶν, carmOt,
perhaps, be transsated into English. It
means, in general, a Divifion of the Peo-
ple into Classes, for more effeetually rai-
fing, and with greater Expedition, the
several Sums necessary -for building and
equipping their Fleets. Yet these are
only occafionally mentioned, and with
all due Reverence for Antiquity, the real
Intention of the Oration, from which
alone it {hould have taken its Title‚ is,
to diffuade the Athenians from proclaim-
ing War against Persia.

’ (1) These Encomiurns on their An-
cestors must have always been received
with exceeding Pleasure by a People vain,

fore

haughty‚ and high-spirited, like theAthe·
nians. In this Pleasure they were too
often indulged by their public Speakers‚
for their own Purposes of Popularity
and Ambition. Upon this Occafion we
may suppose them enflamed by oratori-al
Descriptions of the vietories at Masa-
thon and Plataea, even to a Spirit of
Emulation, that might have been fata!
to the Commonwealth. Our wife and
honest Orator, therefore, direers their
Counsels to more useful and important
Objefts3 and while lie ssiews the Im—
pertinence of praising those Aetiona
whose Greatncss was above Expreffion,
he pronounces upon then] the highest
and most flattering Encomium,
