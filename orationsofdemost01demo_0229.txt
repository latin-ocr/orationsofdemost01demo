each fingle Soldier aeted bravely‚ all must have conquered. (1 1)

Thus in our DebateS, does any one propose, perhapS, not the
best Advice ? Let another rise and deliver his opinion, but not
accuse, who spoke before him. Does any other propose more
salutar-y Counsels ? In the N ame of good Fortune‚ follow them.
“ But they are disagreeable ? ’² Surely the Person, who gave

them, is not culpable, except he hath negled'ced the necessary

Prayers for your Prosperity. Indeed, it were an easy Task for

your Orators‚ O Men of Athens, to form such Prayem, and to
colle& into a very little Compass all the possible good Wishes,

you could form for yourselves 3 (12) but to choose the best Opi-

nion

(1 ι) After all these gallant SentimentS‚
who could believe Demosthenes was a
Coward ? He certainly thought himself
brave, nor imagined, he should be brand-
ed ten Years afterwards with the Infamy
of abandoning his Shield at the Battle of
Choronaea3 a Battle‚ to which he had
animated the Athenians 3 which was
fought upon his Affurances of Success,
and which was to decide the F ate, not of
Athens only, but of Greece. Yet this
Man died with the Calmness and Intre-
pidity of an Hero. But there are In-
stances of Bravoes in private Broils,
who were Cowards in any honourable,
public Action. Instances of Pohrons,
who run away in Battle‚ yet in cold Sense
of Shame have afterwards put themselves
to Death. Such is the Heart of Man.

Paffage is acknowledged of much Diffi-

Construffion. Our Commentators seem

to have mistaken the Arrangement of the
Words. Neither should ἁθροίσαντα be

construed, as it is by Wolfius and his
Editors‚ in a paffive Sense, collzgata3
nor should it be joined with ὅσοι mlvff,
but referred to ’ἔυξασ-θοιι. Let us place
the Words in their grammatical Order.
