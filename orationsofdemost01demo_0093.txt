DEMOSTHENES. 19

Greece, I never can believe. For whither shall he turn him-
self when Greece is conquered? shall he become a Slave in
Phrygia? (13) For to enter into the Service of a Barbarian, is
nothing less than an Engagement for Empire, Life, Manners,
Liberty, and whatsoever else resembles them. Who is there-
fore so deplorably wretched, as voluntarily to lose himself, his
Parents, Sepulchres, Country, for the Sake of a precarious

Stipend? None, I verily believe.

N EI T H E R is it the Perfian's Interest, that his Mercenaries
should subdue Greece. They, who conquer ns, will after-
wards conquer him ; nor hath he any Inclination, for the Sake
of enssaving us, to be himself enssaved. He paffionately wishes

for universal Empire3 or, if that is impossible, to maintain

his Tyranny over his present Slaves. If, therefore, any one

ima-

gaged, πρός τον Βαρςαρον, in the Ser-

(13) The present Transsation hath here
vice of the Barbarian, they must totally

ventured to differ from all oar Corn-

mentators and Transsators. They con-
strue O‘ πρὸς τδν Βάρζαρον πέλεμος, A
War against the Barbarian 3 not consider-
ing, that Demosthenes is representing the
condition of these Mereenaries, when
supposed to have conquered Greece. Wiil
they submit to be Slaves in Phrygia, or
any other Province of Afia ? As a Rea-
son for his Question he affens, That af-
ter such a War, in which they have en-

resign all Views of Empire‚ οι· even of
Liberty. How can they be slaves in
Phrygia, yet enter into a VVar there
against the Barbarian ? The Praepofition

πρός does not necessarily mean adversus,
as our Transsators understand it. πρδς
‘niv βασιλέα apud regem, with Regard
to the King, τα πρός ἡμεῖς, res nostrae.
ra? πρός σ-ωἹηριάν φὲροντα, quae ad sa-
lutem pertinent.
