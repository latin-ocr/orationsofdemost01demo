THERE are two Treaties subsisting between the Grecians
and the King, formed by our Republic, at first universally ap-
plauded, and afterwards even by the Lacedaemonians, by whom
they are now condemned. (1 8) Yet very different are the Mea-
sures of Equity prescribed in these Treaties. F or while, in
lilatters of private Property‚ the Laws have granted in every
separate Polity, one common, equal Participation of Justiee
both to the weak and powerful, yet in the general Administration
