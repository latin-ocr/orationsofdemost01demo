You perhaps approve of what I propose, and now defire to

know, what Supplies may be neceffary, and in what Manner
to be raised. I will inform you distinffly. The capital Sum,
requisite for the Subfistence of this Body of Forces, will amount
to ninety Talents‚ or somewhat inconfiderably more. For ten

ing of our Author require the Correc-
tion. If we read ὑφ ὑμῶν a vobis, al-
though supported by all Editions, Com-
mentators and Transsators, we shall find
his Reasoning inconcluszve. It is not
sufficient, that Menelaus had been ap-
pointed, as he probably waS, by a De-

been preserved with special Faithfulness
and Accuracy by all his Editors without
Exception. What Indulgence therefore

when the Fellows of two Univerfities
could be capable of such Inattentlon ?
