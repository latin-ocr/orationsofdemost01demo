xviii on THE'PoLrTICAL STATE

man Institutione, the perse& Morality of the Gospel. The
Respeffih or ra het the Revemnce, with which the rest of Greece
regarded the Lacedaemoniam rs a noble Proof of the Excellence
of Virtue m itself‚ nor is it less an Honour to human Natur ¹·‚e

that such trnivex·salH0n1age was paid to it, in the Person of
this People. An Ambassador, or even a fimple Mandate, calmed
a domestic Sedition, terminated a Contest between different
Cities, or obhged a Tyrant to abandon ‘an iniquitous Usurpa-
tion. It appeared a Violation of good Sense‚ as well as Vir-
tue, not to submit to a Decifion, where Wisdom guided‚ and
Integrity pronounced Judgement, Thus Lacedaemon insenfibly
became the Capital of Greece, and enjoyed, without a Riva]„

the supreme Command of her Forces, when united.

WERE it posfible the Grecians could' have been contented’
with the Enjoyment of their own domestic Happiness‚ with aa
unambitious Posseffion of their own DominionS, we must ac·-
knowledge they never could have found a People, more in-
terested to prote& them in these EnjoymentS, or less liable to-
violate them, The Banissm1ent of Gold and Silver out of their
Commonwealth must have rendered the Lacedaemonians indif-

ferent to the Spoils and· Tributes of the conquered. Money
was uselesS, contemptible, burthensome. Conquest, and an-

Enlargement of Dominions, never entered into their Ideas of
Vifflory,
