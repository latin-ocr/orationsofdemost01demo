176 οιὶΑΤΙοΝε OF

Treachery, who advised such Measures‚ and of my Integrity,

who gave you better Counsel.

IN another Instance, O Men of AthenS, perceiving, that

Neoptolemus, the Comedian‚ under the Colour and Privilege
of his Art. was fearlessy contriving some pernicious Projeets

against the Republic3 direfflng¹ all your Aetions, all your
Councfls to the Advantage of Philip, and governing you, as if
he were a Magistrate appointed by that Monarch, I came for-
ward and accused him, not from any private Resentment‚ or: ·
my own personal' Delight in accnfing, as by the Consequences-
was manifest. (2) Nor shall 1 now blame the Advocates of Ne·—

opto--

(z) One of· the principal Pleasures the
Athenians enjoyed in their Theatres‚ could
only be tolerated by a democratical Go—
vernment. Their Aaors- were permin-
ted to represent the Persons and Charac-
ters of the MagistrateS, and to make
strong Allufions to their Administration.
The Poets from thence employed their
Talents to introduce into their plays,
whatever Sentiments or Incidents were
applicable to the pre-sent State of Politics„
They flattered‚ applauded, and sometimes
condemned the Condu& of the People
themselves. But the Adors principally
diree‘oed these &pplicationz or sometimes
an unexpee'oed Accident marked them
more strongly. A Verse in AEschylus,
that [lys of Amphiaraus, “ He did not
“ endeavour to appear, but really to be,
*⁴ a good Man ·,” uas by the general

voice of the People applied to Aristi-
des. Philopoemen entered the Theatre ν
the Moment Pylades was singing, ‘³ He
“ who* raised* the gl'orious Fabrick of ”
‘⁵ Grecian Liberty;.” when the whole:
Audience threw their Eyes upon him,
and testified by Shouts of Joy and Ap-
plause, how applicable the Sentirnent was
to that great Man’s Virtue. This Cus-
tom was afterwards received upon the
Roman Stage. Cicero gives us one ln-
stance of it with Regard to himself 3 and·
another, applied to Pompey, is too well
known to be repeated. Neoptolemus
was probably a great Master of this Art,
under the Colour of which, as our Au-
thor expreffes it, he frequently alluded to
Philip’s Probity‚ and Honour 3 his
Esteem and Affeffion for the Republic..
