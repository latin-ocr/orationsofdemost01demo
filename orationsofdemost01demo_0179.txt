DEMOST'HENES. 105

some of your Orators are capable of conceiving, upon the In-
stant, such Expedients as may be useful to the Public, that
among all Opinions your Choice may without Difficulty
be fixed upon those Measures, most conducive to your In—
terests (2)

Bu T indeed the present Occafion, O Men of Athens³ only
not in Words declares, you should take the immediate Admi«
nistration of your Affairs into your peculial· Care, if you have·

any Concern for their Preservation. What Measures you mean

to pursue in this Conjune‘ture, I do not really know. The best,
in my Judgement, is to decree a powerful Succour to the Olyn-
fflians, and to furniss1 it with ‚utmost Expedition3 effeCmally
to asfist them with your national Troops‚ nor any longer suffer
in your own Persons such Indignsties, as you have formerly en-
dured3 to send an Embaffy to inform them what Measures you

have

(Ζ) Demosthenes here speaks in a Lan-
guage superior to that base and malig-
nant Spiris, which can treat with Con-
tempt those T alents we ourselves do not
poss'esS. He was himself reproached, that
his Orations smelled of the Lamp, and
that he was at greater Expence in Oil,
than Wine‚ in composmg them. He an-
swered this Reproach by the modest good
Sense of saying, He had not so good aui
Opinion of his first Thought5‚ as to give
liis Advice upon the Instant, to such a

People‚ as the People of Athens. De-
mades, on the contrary, had those happy
Sallies of Imagination3 that Vivacity of
Genius in finding ExpedientS, which are
sometimes as varluable as the regular Plane,
of a more temperate Understanding. Our
Orator therefore congratulates his Au-

dience upon the Happiness of having it ,

in their Power to employ these different
Spirits to the public Advnntage3 or as
Toum-eil expresses it, these Lightnings
of Geniusj oi· thvsr Lights ofRellexion.
