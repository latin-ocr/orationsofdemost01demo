The ARGUMENT.

HILIP having ended the sacred War by totally destroying the City

of Phocis, and selling its wretched Inhabitants to Slaveiy, convok-
ed an Affembly of the Amphie’tyons, or Council of the States-General of
Greece. The Deputies, who obeyed his Summus, expelled the unhap-
py Phocaeans for Sacrilege in plundering Apollo's Temple, and elec5ted
Philip and his Descendants in their Place. The Athenians were not pre-1
sent at this Affembly; perhaps, because they would not authorise the
Decrees of it by their Presence; or, more probably, because Philip, ap-
prehenfive they would oppose his being ele&ed, had tumultuoussy as-
sembled those Amphi&yons only, who were devoted to his Interests. He
now sends circular Letters to the other States, and among the rest to the
Athenians, to desire a Confirmation of his Eleffion. Demosthenes, with
strong and conclufive Reasons, dissuades them from opposmg this Dig-
nity consen-ed on Philip. It is not of Importanee enough to justify
their renewing the W ar, and probably would provoke not the new Dee
puty alone, but all the N astons, who eleeted him.
