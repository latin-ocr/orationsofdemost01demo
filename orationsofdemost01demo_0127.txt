WHE N therefore, O Men of Athens, when will you act,
as your Glory, your Interest demands? When some new Event
shall happen? When, in the Name of Jupiter! some strong
Neceffity shall compel you? What then shall we deem our pre-
sent Circumstances ? In my Judgement‚ the strongest Neceffity

to a free People, is a Dishonour attending their public Mea-

sures.

Or, tell me, do you purpose, perpetually wandering in

the Market—place, to ask each other, “ Is any Thing new re-

“ ported ?'' (9) Can any Thing be more new, than a Man

says the Scholiast, taken from Hunts-
men, who surround the Paffages in Woods

Sense. But from the Original ςείχω,
vado, inced03 from its Compound πε-
ξιςείχω, circume03 from ς-οιχέω incedo,
it does not seem a Violence to the WVord
περις-οιχίζεται to render it, as Wolfius
does in his Transsation of the Schofiast,
obambulat, ordine circundat.

tation‚ the great Authority of Longinus
for the Spirit and Beauty, not of this
particular Paffage only, but a general
Criticism, to convince us of the l'ower
