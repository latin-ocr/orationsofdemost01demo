DEMOS-THENES. 165

Eyes to the Magistrates, who in their Administration have
wrought such Wonders ; some of whom from extremest Indi-
gence are suddenly-become rich3 others from Obscurity have
risen to the first Honours of the State3 some of them have
built their Houses more splendid and magnificent, than our pub-
lic Edifices3 yet in Proportion, as the Fortune of the Com-
monwealth hath declined, their Fortune hath increased. What
Cause can be assigned for all these Changes? Wherefore was
the Republic then so flourishing 3 wherefore is she now so di.-
streffed? Principally, because the People then were brave

enough to engage in Person in their Wars3 were absolute Mas-
terS

fituated in a dry, sandy soil, consequently
the λης of conveying ‘frater to it, must
have been extremely agreeable to the Peo-
ple. The same Reasoiiing will hold good
with Regard to their repairing their
Streets. It was Matter of real Conve-
nience, as well as measure. Should our
Orator then, in meer Policy, have con-
tradieted the Taste of the People ? C ould
he really do it with Truth and Justice ?
Were these Conveniencies really Tr‘ifles ?
Or supposmg they were such in thern-
selves, does it become his Art, as an Ora-
tor, to represent them as such in this
Comparison ? He should have raised the
present Administration to its highest Point
of tsraise, and allowed it all its supposed
AdvantageS, and then shewn how great-
}y it was inferior to that of their An-
oestors. Thus Poets raise the Heroes,

who are instantly to be conquered. Let
us add, that the Office of rebffilding, re-
pairing, beautifying the Walls of Athens·
was deeined among the first and most ho-
nourable Employments of the Republic.
In this Office, our Author afterwards re-
ceived a golden Crown3 a Reward of
highest Dignity and Honour. Can thi5
Employment then be here called a Trifle ?²
However tedious this Note may be al-
ready, we must remark some Doubts‚

with Regard to the reading of this Pas-

sage. Wolfius reads κοινῶμεν) and trans—

lates it reficimus. A very little Alteration‘
would give us καιμῶμεν, which would·
strietly bear the Sense of reficimus. In

which sense, supported as it is by the*-

Context‚ the present Transsation hath.
ventured to construe it.
