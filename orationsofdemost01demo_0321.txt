ORAT

ION XL

PHILIPPIC.

Lthough many Orations‚ O Men of Athens, are made in

almost every Affembly upon the violent Aets of Hosti-

lay, which Philip, since he ratified the Peace between us, hath

committed not against us only, but against the other States of

Whatever general Apprehenfions the
Athenians might have jnstly entertained
of Philip's ConquestS, yet probably some
more immediate Danger occasioned this
Oration. He now afted openly in Fa-
vour of the Cardians, and supported
them with Money and Troops against
Diopythes. However, he determined in
his own Person to finiss1 his Thracian
Conquests, which, says a French Wri-
ter‚ though little important in themselves,
yet opened him a Way towards the C i-
ties of propontis, and especially towards
Byzantium, which he was always resolv-
ed to unite with his Dominions.

The People of Oreum, in Euboea,
divided by the [itacedonian and Athenian
Faffions, were upon the Point of deter-
min'ng their Quarrel by a civil War.

Philip sent his Party avthousand Mercena-

and at tl e same Time declared ln his Let-
ters, that he had no other Int ention, than to
suppress the seditious, and to fulfil every
Duty of a faithful Friend and Ally to
the'rr Republic. Phssistides, whom he
appointed Governor of Oreum, exerted
his Power in raifing the Macedonian
Faecion. He banissied‚ or sold to Sla-
very, or put to death the principa] Lead-
ers of the opposite Party.
