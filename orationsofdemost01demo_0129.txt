may she one Day perFe& this her own Work) be affurcd, if
you were near his Dominion8‚ and ready to advanee upon the

general Disorder of his Affairs, you might dispose of every
ffThing according to your Pleasure. (ι 1) But in your present
Dispofition should some favourable Conjune'ture even deliver up
Amphipolis to you, thus flustuating in your Operations and

your Councils, you could not receive the least Benefit from the

Poffeffion, with Regard to Macedonia. (12)

YET since you must affuredly be conscious, that we ought to

-exert our whole F orce upon this Occafion, Ι hold it unneces-
