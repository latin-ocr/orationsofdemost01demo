tion of them is absolutely disagreeable to yotl, for in your In-
dignation against them, you are unable to hear with Temper,
either Truth afl'erted of them, or any Thing honourable of

their Chara&er. It is, however, their Duty, who debate on

Affairs of Importance, not upon any Pretext, to pass over in
Silence whatever Counsel may be conducive to the public Wel-
sare. I therefore declare my own Opinion, that the Thebans,

Genius and Manners, ever should enter-
tain any Sentirnents of Friendlhip, ot
Esteem for each other. Our Orator,
however, was far superior to vulgar, na-
tional PrejudiceS. He considered, with-
out Partiality, the real Interests of his
Country, whose Welfare should be a
Statesman’s only Paffion, yet his Regard
