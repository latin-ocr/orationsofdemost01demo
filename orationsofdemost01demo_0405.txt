The ARGUMENT.

H ILIP's Letter is read in an Asscmbly of the People. They arc

divided in their Sentirnents, as they are differently agitated by Ter-
rour and Alarm, by Resentment and Indignation. The Traytors, who
had sold themselves to Philip, endeavour to deserve the wretched Price
of their Corruption. Our Orator rises in the Debate. He does not deign
to deny the Fac'ts asserted in Philip’s Letter, or to refute his Reasoning
by a cold Detail of Arguments. He considers it himself, and is per»
suaded the People universauy consider it, as an actual Declaration of
War, insolent and menacing. He appeals to the Gods, and relies with
Confidence on their Proteffion, as they are the just Avengers of Perfidy
and Violence. Nor is the Macedonian any longer represented as an Ob-·
je& of T errour. The Gods, the Grecians, Perfians, Macedoni-ans and
Philip himself denounce his approaching Destruction. Athens alone
continues to support him by her Indolence and Inactivity. From thence
the strong Neceffity of immediate, powerful and effectual Measures.

The Letter was written, and consequently this Oration prononnced
in the first Year of the hundred and tenth Olympiad.
