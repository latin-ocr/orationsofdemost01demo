158 ORATIONSOF

NOR have I unadvisedly determined to speak in this Mamer,
to make myself an Objeet of popular Detestation 3 for neither -
am Iso inconsiderate in myself, nor so unhappily abandoned
by Fortune‚ as willingly to make myself odious, without even
purpofing any Advantage to the Republie 3 but I esteem it the
Part of a good Citizen to prefer the Safety of the Common—
wealth to an Oration merely defigned to give Pleasure to his
Hearers.⁴ For I have often, and perhaps you may yourselves
have heard, that in the Times of our Ancestor33 the great Ora-
tor53 Aristides, Nicias, Demosthenes, and Pericles (whom all
the Speakers of these Days applaud‚ but never imitate) made
use of these Maxims 3 this Kind of Polity in their Administra-
tion. (14) But fince these Declaimers have appeared 3 these

oblig-

had really performed these glorious Ac-
tions. But this Kind of Anachronisms

animating the Athenians to succour
Olynthus, but we cannot mark it with

Exuetness. We only know with Certain-
ty‚ that the Megareans abandoned the
Alliance of the Athenians3 put their Gar-
rison to the Sword, and even joined with
the Corinthians against thern. They re-
sented this Perfidy with so much Indig-
meon, as to forbid them to enter their
Harboms, or frequent their Markets.
But these are only Proofs of general En-
mity, not Examples of Athenian Mag-
nanimity in succouring their Allies.

By the Language, in which Demos-
thenes expresses himself, we might ima-
gine, that the People to whom he speaks

is allowed to Eloquence3 which thus trans—
fers to the Descendants the Glory'of their
Ancestors. The Manner is infinuating,
and goes clireffly to the Hem-t. No Ex-
ample strikes us so powerfully as our
own, nor is there any Thing gives us
more Pleasme, than to imitate ourselves.
TOURREIL.

(¹4) It is almost an Affront to these
illnstrious Persons to attempt giving their
I-Iistory or C haraeters in these little Notes.
Yet every Thing must be attempted for

the Pleasure and Information of the Eng-

liih Reader.
