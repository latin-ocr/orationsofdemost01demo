the Genius and Disposition of the Theffalians alarmed him,
sor they were always, and to all Mankind, by Nature perfi-
dious.(ro) Such as their Manners have ever been, such
are they now to Philip. They have decreed to demand
the Restitution of Pagasae‚ and have forbidden him to for-
tify Magnesia. Belides, Iam informed, they will no longer
pay him those Duties‚ and Taxes, which they once granted
him in their Ports and Markets 3 because what belongs to the
common State of Theffaly, they think ought to be employed
in their own Administration‚ not received by Philip. Were he

deprived of this Revenue, he would be greatly distreffed for
the Subfistence of his Mercenaries.

Breach of Faith by his Commerce with
that People. If the Men of this Na-
tion were thus distinguissied as Knaves,
the Women were not less remarkable as
Wirches. Why have I not, says Strep-
siades in AristophanCS, a Thessaliam Witch

in my Service, whose Power could bring

Creditors‚ who make me pay such ex-
orbitant Interest every Month. If there
were no Maon, they could have no
Month. Goeece, but Athens particular-
ly, had often proved their Perfidy. At
the Battle of Tanagra in Boeotia, while the
Vffitory was yet doubtful, and in the very
heat of the Battle, the Theffalian Horse
left their Allies the Athenians‚ and passed

over to the Lacedaemonians. Toumzru„
