212 ORATIONSrOF

Men of Athens, to lay afide all partial Confiderations, and ia

full Ass’embly to decree, and to execute whatever you judge
most conducive to the public Welfare.

YotJR principal Attention therefore at present should be fixed'
upon the Situation of Affairs‘ in Chersonesus, and Philip’s Ex-
pedition into Thrace, in which he hath been now eleven Months-
engaged. Yet almost a-ll our Orations tend to the Conducl: of
DiopytheS, and even his future Defigns. However‚ when

any of our own Citizens is accused, whom you have it in your
Power to punish according to Law, whether upon the Instant,
or with whatever short Delay you please, Ι am of opinion„ we
may take a larger Time for our Inquiries‚ and. that neither 1,
nor any other should make it a Subjeet of violent Contention.
But when Philip, the constant Enemy of this Republic, and
even now encamped with a powerful Army near the Hellespont,
attempts to pofless himself of our Cities there, which-if we de-
]ay to succour immediately, we shall never be able to preserve,
these are Subje&s‚ in my Judgement‚ upon which it were of ’
Importance with the soonest to consult, and to decree the ne—
ceffary Preparation3‚ nor should you suffer your Attention to be

diverted from them by tumultuous Debafies, and Accusations.

ALTHOUGH accustomed to wonder at the Proposals frequent- ’

Iy made yon, yet never was my Wonder greater, O Men of
Athens,
