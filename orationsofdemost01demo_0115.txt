refign the Dominion of Oropus, which rightfully belongs to
Athens 3 or should it prove otherwise 3 should the Thebans
oppose us in the Restoration of Thespiae and Plataea (as We
must reasonably expe6t, fince they may well imagine it will
bring inevitable Ruin upon their Republic) it is confefl‘ed that
all our Measures will be frustrated5 but what indeed will be
the Event, if we perpetually suffer Cities really flourilhing to
be destroyed, and demand the Restoration of others, when laid
in Ruins ?

Reason, affert, that the Arcadians must certainly throw down
the Columns upon which their Treaties with the Thebans are

inscribed, if they purpose to be firmly our Allies. Yet the
Arcadians themselves affirm, not Columns, but Interests of
State, constitute Friendship 3 and that they, who relieve and
affist them in their Distreffes, they alone should be confidered
‚by them as Allies.
