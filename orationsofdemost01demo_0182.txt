108 ORATIONS OF

ssiould with Chearfulnesss, with Ardour, give your :whole At-
tention, if cis-er, certainly now, to the War3 bringing in your
Contributions with .-'Xlacrity; marching yourselves to the Field,
and leaving nothing, that concerns the public Welfare, neglect-
ed. For there is no longer either Reason lest, or Excuse for
vIrresolution and Inafflon. What you once unanimoussy and
clamouroully demanded, that the Olynthians should be preffed
to declare 'War against Philip, is of itself come to past, and in
a Manner most advantageous to the Republic. For had they,
‚by our Persuasion, undertaken the War, they had, perhaps,

been very uncertain Allies, and for some Time only continued
their Resolution. But since they now detest Philip for their

own proper Injuries, it is probable their Resentment will be

firmly fixed, both by theirfuture Fears, and by what they have
already suffered. Such an Occafion, O Men of Athens, thus
voluntarily offering itself, ought not to be neglected ; nor
ssiould you commit the same Erroms, you have often commit-
ted. For Instauoe, when we returned from succouring the
Euboean3‚ and the Amphipolitans, Ierax and StratocleS, upon
this very Tribunal conjured you to fail, and receive their City

into your Protcetion, had you been animated with the same
Spirit for your own Interests, as you had shewn for the Safety

of

Custom of succouring the distreffed; the and the apparent Danger of the Repub›
