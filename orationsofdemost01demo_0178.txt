TION V

FirstOLYNTHIAC.

HAT you would prefer, O Men of AthenS, before all
posfible Treasures, those Counsels, that shall appear in

our present Deliberations of greatest Advantage to the Com-

monwealth, I really believe. (1)

In this Dispofition therefore

you ought to hear, with a favourable Attention, whoever is will-

ing to propo-se his Advice.

Not only should you hear the salu-

÷tary Scheme, which hath been formed and matured by Reflex-

ion, but Ι deem it an Instance of your good Fortune, that ’

It is disputed among the Crines, which
³of the three Olynthiacs was first spoken.
This Edition follows the ancient Arrange-
ment, nor will the Transsator enter into
the Merits of the Debate, imagining it
'cannot be matter of much Importance,
since there is nothing in the Orationss¹
themselves absolutely sufficient to deter-
mine their order, and smce they were
certainly spoken in the same Year ·‚ either
the fourth of the hundred and severim, or
the first ofthe hundred and eighth Olym-
piad. Our Author was then in the thirty-
fecond or thirty-third Year of his Age.

(1) As it was the principa] Intention
of these Orations to persuade the People
to restore the Funds, which they had la-
vished away upon theatrieal Shows and
Entertainnoents, to their proper, original
Destination, the military Serviee, our
Orator not unartfully begins with a Com-
pliment to the Generofity of his Au-
dience, and their Contempt of Money.
Confidered in any other Light, this open·
ing would appear a cold, philosophica]
Sentiment‚ and most impertinently in-
troduced. ULPJAN·
