reign Authority in Pherae, Pagasae, Magnesia, he marches with

Having regulated every — Thing with a sove-

Rapidity into Thrace. There depofing and appointing Kings,
he falls into a dangerous Illness. (7) Recovering his Health,
he does not bend his spirit to Indolence, but instantly attacks
the Olynthians. His Expeditions against the Illyrians‚ Paeoni-
ans, Arymbas and others (for who can number them ?) I do
not mention. “ But wherefore talk to us of his Expeditions ?''

That you may be convinced‚ O Men of Athens, how destruc-

doms and Empires are influenced by the
Genius and Abilities of their Sovereigns·
In the first of the hundred and fifth
Olympiad he took Poffeffion of the crown
of Macedonia. He found the Kingdom
wholly destitute of Assies 3 divided by in-
testine Faffion53 exhausted of its Trea-
sures ; its Armies broken and dispirited3
itself a Tributary to the Illyrians. Yet
in four Years he restored the Courage of
his People; made them formidable to
their Neighbours 3 enlarged his Frontiers
and defeated the Pretenders to his Th rone·
In the same Number of Years he entered
into several fort-ign &Vm-s, and always
with Glory and Success, till he became
an Object of Terrour to an the States of
Greece. Eleven Years afterwards his
victory at Cheronoea made him absolute
Master of Greece, her Armies and her
Treasures, which opened to him the
Conquest of Asia, and the Ru'm of the

tive ’

Persian Empire. He had Abilities, For--
ces and Courage equal to the Conquest
of the VVorld, when a violent Death put
an End to all his Defigns. Luccmsm.

(7) Cotys, King of Thrace, died in‘
the fourth of the hundred and fixth
Olympiad‚ when his Son Chersobleptes
was acknmvledged by the Athenians sole
Sovereign of Thrace, for his Enmity to
Philip, as they expreffed it in their De—
cree, and his Friendsnip to Athens. He
had however two Competitors for the
C rown, Amadocus and Berisadss. Phih'p
enters into the Qlarreh puts to Death
Amadocus and BerIsade53 confirms Te-
res in one Part of the Kingdom and Cher-
sobleptes, to whom he was reconciled, in
the other ·, then lays a general Ταῖς upon
the Thraciam, and erefts forts upon their '
Frontiers to quell any future Commo-
