fity of deliberating, not upon the common Rights of Greece;
not upon foreign Affairs, but upon the Defence of your own pro-
per TerritorieQ and the Condu& of the War, that now threat-
ens Attica. A War‚ >which will affuredly be full of Calamity
to us all, whenever it shall appear, but which really began that
Day, when we yiclded up Thermopylae. For had you not
been then deceived, nothing could have now distrefsed the Repub-
lic. N either was Philip then powerful enough by Sea to have
attempted a Descent upon the Coast of Attica, nor, by Land,
to march beyond T hermopylae, and Phocis 3 but either he must
have acted with stri& Regard to Justice‚ and preserved the Peace
inviolable‚ or instantly been engaged in a War like that, which
obliged him lately with so much Earnestness to defire a Peace.
Sufficient therefore has been said, to make you recolleet your
present Dangers. That you should ever prove them more clearly
by Experience, O all ye Gods l may it never come to pass. For
¹I would not, that any Man, however justly meriting Destruc-
tion, should be punished‚ if his Punishment must be attended
'with universal Danger, and public Calamity.
