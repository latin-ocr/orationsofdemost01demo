the People by expelling their Tyrants, and restoring their Right
of prefiding in the Council of AmphyfflonS. In Thebes it was
unsafe, until he ceded Boeotia to her, and with a total Destruc-

tion destroyed the Phocaeans. But in Athens, not only when
Philip had despoiled us of Amphipolis and Cardia, with the

Territories round it, but while he was erecting Euboea into a

is marching to Byzantium, still it is perfeffly safe to exert our
Eloquence in Favour of Philip.v Thus have some of these Ora-
