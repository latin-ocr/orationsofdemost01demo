The ARGUMENT.

U R Orator⁷s Eloquence had not, in this last Oration, its usual Suc-
cess. The People‚ intimidated by the Power of Philip, or amu-

sed by his Promises‚ either did not decree the Succours Olynthus had de·
manded, or appeared cold and irresolute in the Execution of their De-
crees. Conscious of their F ears, our Author endeavours to animate them
with his own Resolution 3 to inspire them with the Love of Glory, of
Liberty, and their Country. Philip is‘no longer represented as an Ob·-
je& of Terrour. He hath exhausted all those Artifices, by which he hath
imposed upon the States of Greece. Perjury and Perfidy‚ by which he
rose to Greatness, are the unstable Foundations of his ConquestS. His
hereditaxy Dominions are weakened by his Expeditions ς his Subjecsts
groan beneath the Calamities, they suffer from his Ambition. His Al-
lies are alm-med at the Progress of his Arnas, and the Nations he hath
subdued, are shaking off the Yoke of Tyranny. Hc is deserted by For-
tune 3 abandoned by the Gods; detested by all human Kind‚ and sup-
ported only by the Indolence, Irresolution and Inac‘iivity of the Athenians.
