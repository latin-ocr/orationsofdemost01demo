fisting the Meffenians‚ at such a Conjundmre, you will to all

Mankind appear to wish the Preservation of Meffene, not more

from Motives of Justice, than from your own Apprehenfions

of the Lacedaemoniaiis.

We ought indeed always to think,

and always to a& upon Principles of Equity, yet at the same

Time observe with Attention, that these Principles are condu—

cive to the public Interest. (2)

(z) To fhew the Force of our Ora—
tor’s reasoning in a stronger Light, it
may be necessary to give the Reader a
{hort History of the Meffenians, their
interests, Politics, and situation, with
Regard to Greece. Animated by the
Love of Liberty and of their Country, they
had supported a long War with various
Success, although with very unequal
Strength‚ against the Lacedaemonians.
They were at last totally subdued, and
either sold to Slavery, or dispersed
through the Cities of Greece‚ by whom
'they were treated with the Regard due to
their Virtne. After the Battle of Leuc-
tra, lipari-sinendis, not in Compaffion
only to their Misfortunes, but at once
to mortify and distress the Lacedaemo-
hians, restored -them to their Country.
Thus after their Disperfion andSla—very
sor three hundred Years, during which
Time they had preserved their Manners,
Qstoms, and ngmge, they returned

with the same Hatred to Sparta, the
same Love of Country,¹ and the same
Paflion for Liberty. Apprehenfive of
the Theban Power, the Lacedaemonians
were compelled to suffer their Restora·
tion, which however they considered as
a perpetual Affront and Ignominy. At
the general Peace therefore concluded
after the Battle of Mantinea, they alone
refused to include the Mefl‘enians in the
common Treaty‚ and when the Thebans
were engaged in the Phocaean War, they
formed an Expedition against Messene,
who immediately sent her Ambaffadors
to Athens to solicit her Affistance. The
Athenians returned this Answer‚ that
t‘hey would neither commit Hostilities
against the Lacedaemonians, nor suffer
thern to invade the Messenians.

In this little History we see the poli·-
tical Interests of Athens, the Ambition.
of Sparta, and the importance of Mess
