shdors to Peloponnesus, Rhodes, Chios, and the King of Per-

fia, to inform them of our Intentions3 for the Persian is not
unconcerned in Point of Interest, to oppose the Progress of this
Destroyer. If you succeed in these Embaffies‚ you may have
Confederates who will divide with you the Dangers of the War,
and if it be necessary, the Expence. If you are unsucccssful
in your Negotiations‚ you will however gain Time upon your
Enemy in the Execution of his Projecss. Nor is this of incon-
fiderable Importance‚ when you are to maintain a War aga-inst
a Man, who is Master of his own Defigns and the Execution of

thern, not against the Strength of a pop'ular Government‚ in

which so many different Interests must unite in every Measure.
Nor useless were your Embaffies last Year into Peloponnesus,
and your Remonstrances against Philip, when the inestimable
Polyeucflus‚ and Ι, and others were appointed your Ambaffa-
dors, and so effectually checked his Impetuosity, that he nei—

ther dared to invade Ambracia, nor make an Irruption into Pe·-
loponnesus,

ΒΗΤ while we are ourselves unwilling to take the necessary
Measures for our own Safcty, I by no means advise our sending
Ambaffadors to any other State. It were >absurd to abandon all»
Concern for our own domestic Interests, yet profess an Anxi-

cty for those of foreign Natious 3 or to behold with perse& In-

sensibility
