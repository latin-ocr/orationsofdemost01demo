WHOEVER compute3‚ that the Plan I have proposed, will
require a large Expence‚ numberless Fatigues and constant Ap-
plication, certainly computes with Judgement3 for numerous

the Distreffi8‚ most numerous, which of Neceffity asise from
War. Yet if 116 reckon the CalamitieS, that will afiuredly be-

fall the Republic‚ if he refuse to execute this Scheme‚ he will
be convinced it is our Interest with Chearfulness to discharge our
Duty. For although some God were Surety (and nothing mortal
were worthy of our Belief in a Matter of this Irnpormnce) that:
if you continue to observe the Pence and abandon the W orld
to this Oppreffor, yet he never will dire-st his Conquests 11111161,
1 swear by all our Deities‚ it were extremest Turpitude‚ and un-
worthy of your Charafter 3 οξ 1116 Majesty of Athens, and the
illustrious Affions of your Ancestor8‚ to abandon, for the Sake of
indulging your own Indolence of Spirit‚ the universal states
of Greece to Servitude. For myse]f‚ let me rather die, than-
offer you such Advice. If any other proposeS, and persuades
you to follow such Counsels, then be it so: attempt not to re-
pel this Destroyer, and abandon all Defence. But ff no Athe-
nian yet thinks thus basely 3 if on the contrary We universally
foresee‚ that in Proportion as we suffer him to extend his Con-
quefls, so shall we find him a more dangerous and formidable
Enemy, wherefore do we delay? Why do we procrastinare?

Or when, O Men of Athens, will you resolve to perform your
1 Duty
