“with your own exceeding Glory. The Byzantians, Chians,
Rhodiam, accused us of forming infidious Defigns against their*
LibertieS, and from thence entered into one common League
against us in the late War. It shall now manifestly appear, ’
that Mausolus (he, who, while he profeffed himself the Friend
of the Rhodiam, violently deprived them of their Liberty) was
their principal Direc‘lzor and Adviser: (2) that the Chians and
Byzantinus, with whom they had entered into an Alliance, ne—
ver sent the least Succour to their Misfortunes‚ but that you,

os whom they entertained such Terrours, are their alone De-

sende1·s aud Preservers. (3)

(2) Mausolus, King of Caria, was
Husband and Brother of Artemisia, for
it was a custom established among the
Cariam, that their Kings should marry
their Sisters, and that the Widow should
succecd her Husband, preferably to his
Brome, or even his Children. Mau-
solus had affisted the Confederates in the
socia} war, and supported the Oligarchy
of Rhodes, or had rather enssaved the
whole kcople. He died two Years be—
fore this Cration was spoken, when the
Feople, it is probable‚ had not yet risen
to affert their Liberties. Luceffisffl.

( 3.) It was the political Interest of Chios,
as a democratical State, to have affisted
the Rliodians in recovering their Free-
dom. They were probably restrained by
their Fears of Artemifia, for whatever
Wonders Historians have related of the
Sorrows of this Princess for the Death

of her Husband3 her erecting the fa-
mous Mausoleum 3 instituting Games to
his Memor-y, and even drinking his Ashes,
we may believe, by the Manner she is
mentioned in this Oration, that she did
not forget ssie was a Qecn, even amidst
these extraordinary Sorrows os her Wi-
dowhood. -Vi—truvius relates a bold and
successful Stratagem, by which she de-
stroyed a confiderable Body of Forces‚
sent by the Rhodi-ans to dethrone her3
got Poffeffion of their Fleet‚ and sub-
dued the Issand. They probably did not
recover their Liberry till her Death, two
Years after that of her Husband. We
may form some Judgement of the Spirit
of this disconsolate Widow, from the
Trophy she erected for her Victory, with
two Statues of Bronze, one representing
the City of Rhodes, the other her own

Person branding it with an hot iron. Vi-
