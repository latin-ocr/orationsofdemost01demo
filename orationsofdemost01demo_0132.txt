Plan I propose, is not wholly to be despised. For when he
knows how perfeffly well you are prepared to receive him, and
he will most exaffly know, (for there are many, too many
among us, who inform him of all your Designs) he will either,
in his Fears, continue to observe— the Pence, or treating our
Preparations with Contempt, may be surprised unguarded. No-
thing hindering our mal-:ing a Descenr even upon Macedonia,

Historians. Let the Reader try thern in
a general Sense, and he will find them
equally spiritless as Facis, and inconclu-
five as Arguments.
