The ARGUMENT.

HE Lacedaemoniam, reduced to the utmost Distress by the Loss
of the Battle of Leu&ra‚ sent Ambaffadors to Athens to solicit

Succours against the Thebans. The Athenians‚ always genereus and
humane, supported them vigouroussy both by Sea and Land. Thus
affisted they recover, in some Degree‚ their ancient Strength and Spirit.
They defeat the Arcadians 3 enter the Territories of Megalopolis, which
was built as a Barrier against their Incurfions‚ and prepare to befiege
it. The Megalopolitans instantly send an Embaffy to Athens to im-
plore its Proteffion. Demosthenes supports them with his usual Vi-
gour. The Cause was difficult and delicate ; to persuade the Atheni-
ans to asfist the Peoplepf Arcadia, their ancient Enemiea, against the

Lacedaemoniam, their late Allies.

WE know not the Success of his Oration, but as Diodorus, who
names anthe other States, that sent any Aflistance to the Megalopo-
litans, does not mention the Affienians, we may believe it did not
succced. It was spoken in the fourth of the hundred and fixth Olym..
piad, when our Orator was in his eight and twentieth Year.
