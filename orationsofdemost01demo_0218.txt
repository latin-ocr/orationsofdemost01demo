ORATIONVH.

Third OLYNTHIAC.

AM by no Means able, O Men of Athens, to form the
same consistent Judgement of the State of the Republic,
when I consider our circumstances in themselves, and when I
hear the· Speeches of our Orators. Their Orafions, I perceive‚
are formed on a Resolution of being revenged on Philip for

past Injuries 3 while our Circumstances tend only to the Ne-

Our

Orators therefore, seem to me to commit no other Mistake,

cessity of protedfing ourselves against his future Insults.

than propofing a Qestion to you, which is not really the Sub-

IN Compliance with the general Opi-
nion, we are willing to believe, that Suc-
cours had been sent to the Olynfflians,
yet there is not any the least Warrant in
History for this Opinion‚ nor is it sup-
ported by any one Expreffion in our Au<
thor. W bether they were sent before
these Orations, or during the distant Pe-
riods of Time, when they were pro-
nounced, is equally uncertain. The pre-
sent Oration supposes the Nevvs of some
considerable Advantage gained by the
Olynthians‚ perhaps in Conjunetion with

je&
the Athenian Auxiliaries. The People,
for Insolence and Presumption were among
their national F onies, are suddenly elated,
and indulge themselves in imaginary
Triumphs over Philip, as if their Vic-
tory were complete, andtlte War ended.
Their Orators‚ who {foke before De-
mosthenes, had probably, with their ufi1al
Flattery and Adulation, confirmed thern
in these Sentinatem, so pernicious to their
true Interest, which demanded still more
powerful Succours to support the Olyn-
thiana.
