PHILIP‘s Letter to the EUBOEANSJ*

AN Y Parts of this Letter, O Men of Athens, are un-

deniably true (it should be otherwise) though perhaps
disagreeable to hear. But if an Orator could in Reality, as in
Words‚ pass over whatever might be offenfive to his Audience,
all popular Orations ssiould be formed only to please. But
when this pleafing Art of speaking, if not in some Measure
profitable, is in Fa& pernicious, it is shameful‚ O Men of
Athens, to delude yourselves, and by rejeeting what may per-

haps be disagreeable, to be for ever too late in all your Opera-
tions. Shameful, not to be capable of learning this Maxim,

that they, who conduet a War with Success, do not follow
Conjun&ure8‚ but lead them. For as we hold it fitting, that,
a General should march at the Head of his Army, so should
an able Counsellor command Events; that every Measure he
approves‚ may be carried into Execution, and that he himself

may not be compelled to follow Contingencies and Chances.

Bu T although you are superior to every other Grecian State
in Ships, Infantry‚ Cavalry and Revenues‚ never, even to this

Day, have you employed them to any valuable Purposes 3 never ,
gained

tous, We may believe it was written nians
