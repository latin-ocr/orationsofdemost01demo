DEMOSTHENES. 63

only one Man excepted, whom you have indeed sent to the
Campaign, vwhat do they perform? They march in Procesfion
with your Priests. For as Pottcrs mould their Imagcs for some
public Solemnity, so do you form Coloncls and Aids du Camp
for the Forum, not for the War. But were it not fitting, O
Men of Athens, that¹ the principa] Commanders both of your
Horse and Foot should be created out of your own Citizens,
that your Army may be really the Army of the Republic?
Yet an Athenian Gener-al must, it seems, ‘embark for Lemnos,
⁷ and Menelaus, a Foreigner, command that very Cavalry, which

is to defend your own Dominions. (19) Nor do Ι mention this

Instance with a Defign‘ of accufing Menelaus, but to convince

you,

fore acknowledged, that his present Cri-
ticism does not want Vivacity. But be-
fides that unavoidable Neceffity of mal<-
ing Use in a Transsation of whatever
Terms, in Arts and Sciences especially,
can best express the Meaning of an an-
cient Author‚ or give even an imperfect
Idea of it, in this Instance the Remark
seems unhappily placed. There is an
Air of pompous Irony in repeating with
so much Solemnity, the Titles of these
Commanders, which is wholly lost in

- Olivet’s Transsation, pour exercet toutes

les charges neceffaires dans une armee.
Supposmg the Sense preserved, the Spirit
‘is intirely lost.

(19) The Name of Menelaus would
have been totally unknown, if not pre—

served to us by our Author. He was
probably a Phocaean, as the Athenians
were in the strlc‘lest &lllance with that
People, and particularly were their Con-
federates in the sacred &Vas against Phi-
lip and the Thebans. It is not unlikely,
that he commanded their Foras, when
they repulsed that Moriar-ch at Ther-
mopylae, and was still continued in the
Command, from a probable Apprehen-
sion of his making a second Attempt.
It was certainly most useful to have a
Gmeral, who knew the Situation of the
Country ·‚ the Genius, Interests and Min-
ners of its Inhabitants, and whose per-
sonal Influence and Authority among
them might better provide for the Troops
he command-ed. Luceflnsmx„
