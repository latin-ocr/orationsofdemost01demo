DEMOSTHENES.

Republic formerly maintained in Corinth a Body of Mercena-

61

rieS, commanded by Polystratus, Iphicrates, Chabrias and
others; (16) that you yourselves personally engaged in the W ar,
and that they being united with yon, and you with them, you con-
quered the Lacedaemonians. But from the Moment these mer-
cenary Forces alone undertake your Vv‘ars‚ they conquer both
your Confederates and Allies, while your Enemies become dan-
geroussy powerfu13 or if ever they turn afide their Eyes to the

War of this RepubliC, they desert to Artabazus, οι· embark sor

any foreign Expedition. (17)

( 16) The Name of Polystratus has been
thought wholly unknown. Mr. Mounte-
ney alone hath observed‚ that our Author
again mentions him with Iphicrates. Tour-
reil imagines we should read Callistratus.
Lucchefini thinks Demosthenes wrote Phi-

locrates, who was Joint-Commander of
mercenary F orces at that Time in the Ser-

vice of Athens. It is remarkable, tharan
English Transsation by Doetor willon,
in the Reign of Qeen Elizabeth‚ reads
Philocrates, from whence we may believe
it was a Manuscript-Reading.

(17) Καὶ παρακύψαντα ἐπὶ τᾶν τῆς
πόλεως πόλεμον hath a Peculiarity, if not
an Oddness‚ of Expreffion, that ought
to be explained. Wolfius transsates, &
curn vix nostra civitatis bellum attige-
runt, but παρακόπτοι) never can bear
this signification, not even metaphori-
cally. Κύπτω signifies inclinare caput,
demittere oculos, but never, as he asserts
in his Neres, obiter respicere. Lucche—

Their General follows them,

and

fini therefore translates the Sentence‚ ob—
liquis oculis bellum a republica suscep-
tum prospicientes.

Our Anthor probably had in his View
the Behaviour of Chares and his Fleet.
Diodorus gives us this Account of his
Expedition.

Chares was wholly employed in avoid-
ing the Enemy and distressing the Allies.
For sailing to Corcyra, an Issand in Al-
liance with Athens, he raised such Com-
motions there, that many of the Citi-
zens were put to Death, and their H oufes
plundered. Thus he performed nothing
either honourable or advantageous to his
Country‚ but exposed her Reputation to
the Calumnies of her Enemies‚ and the
Resentment of her Allies.

In a second Expedstion, some four
Years afterwards, he affisted Artabazus,
who was in open Rebellion against Ar-
taxerxes. Diodorus, in obscuret Tei-ms,
