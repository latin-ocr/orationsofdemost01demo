paying the Obligation of that Affistance, which each of us re-

that· Athens, without abandoning any one Arcadian to the La-
cedfemonians‚ will be able to recover Oropus; and even, by
their Affistance to recover it, if they are willing to a& upon

principles of Equity, as well as in Conjunffion with some other
States of G1·eece‚ who are not of Opinion‚ that the Thebans
ought to poffess the Dominions of others· (4) Yet were it

evident, that unless we suffered the Lacedaemonians to lay waste
Peloponnesus, we could not be able to recover Oropus, I truly
think, it were more eligible, if 1 may be permitted to speak
my Sentiments, to cede the Poffeffion of it to the Thebans

Lacedaemoniam 3 sor this, in my Judgement, is not the only

The Manner of Expreffion here is re-

who are not of Opimam while he meam,
who are determined not to suffer the The-
bans to possess the Dominions of Athens.
Negatives‚ in general, have a secret and
infirmating Power, far stronger than open
and dire& Affirmatives.
