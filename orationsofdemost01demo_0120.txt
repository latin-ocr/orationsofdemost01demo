The ARGU‘MENT.

T HE Rapidity of his Conquests‚ the numerous F orces he command-
ed, and his own enterprifing Spirit‚ had long smee made Philip

of Macedon an 01)]εᾶ of much Apprehenfion to the Athenians. He
had lately taken several Thracian Cities; Confederates and Allies of
Athens. The Year before this Oration, he had totally routed the Pho-
caeans, and this present Year had attempted to march into Phoci, through
the Pass of Thermopylae. The Athenians opposed him, and with Suc-
cess. They now deliberate upon their Condu& towards him. De·
mosthenes advises an immediate Declaration of War. Shews the Neces-
fity of such a Measure, both from Motives of Interest and Glory. Lays
down a Plan for their military Operations. Paints the Dangers of the
Republic in the strongest Colours. Flatters and reproaches. Terrifies
and encourages ; for while he represents Philip as truly formidable, he
represents him indebted for the Power, which made him thus formida-7
ble, only to the Indolence and Inaftivity of the Athenians. i

Our Author pronounced this Oration in the first year of the hun-
dred and seventh Olympiad, when he was nine and twenty Years of Age.
