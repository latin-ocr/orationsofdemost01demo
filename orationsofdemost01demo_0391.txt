The ARGUMENT.

’ < HILE Philip pursued his Conquests in the Field with his usual

. Succes‘s‚‚ he was not unattentive to the Arts of Negotiation ·‚
nor was he less indebtecl to them, than to the Vigour of 'his Arms. The
following Letter is a Kind of Manifiesto, in which by a numerous Train

of F affts, and much Speciousness of Argument‚ he endeavours to prove.
that the Athenians had violated the Peaee, and commenced Hostilities».

He warmly resents their entering into an A1liance against· him with the
Perfian, as against the common Enemy of Greece3 then vindicates his
own Condu& and afferts his religibus Observance of Treaties. He con--
eludes with an Appeal to the Gods for the Justice of his Cause, and his Re·-¹
liance on their Affistance in vindicating* his Honour, afferting his Rights3,
and chastismg his Enemies. Ι
