Yet these Things have really come to pass, and

(8) whatever Respee't we ought to
entertain for the Text of an ancient Au-
thor, we ssiould not revere the vifible
En‘ours of Copyists. All our l‘ditions
read δεκαδαρχίαν, but Theffaly was in
F a& divided into Ten-archies, as our Ora·
tor himself expressly informs us in his
third Philippic, τετραδαρχιόις κατ-ἔζησε
7:233 αὐτοῖς. 'We have, befides, the Au-

Council of Amphietyons was sometimes
called Pylrea, from Pylae or Thermopy-

conjecitures, that he rather intends some
lucrative Employment3 some Presents or
Perquifites arifing to Philip from his be-
ing l’refident of the Pythian Games,
which probably were called Pylaean‚ when
celebrated at Thermopylae. These he
might generoussy have given to the Thes—
saliaris. Befides, unless Demosthenes
means some pecuniary Emolument, the
just Exaeiness of his Comparison is lost.
It were impertinent to oppose the Am·
phi&yonic Dignity to Theffalian Reve-
nues. What lnference from such an Op-
position? “ The Thessalians, being ho-
“ noured with a Seat in the Council of
“ Ampliietyons, never imagined he would.
“ have taken from them their own Reve-
“ nues.” Neither was it unusual f0r the
Pei-sons, who presided over these Games,
to yield some Portion of the sacrifices
and Presents to others.
