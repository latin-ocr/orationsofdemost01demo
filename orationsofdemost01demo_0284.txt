The ARGUMENT.

CHersobleptes had ccded Chersonesus to the Athenians, who sent i*
Colony to take Poffeffion of it. The Cardians- affert their Inde-
pendence and refuse ‘to admit the Colony. Diopyffies, the Athenian Ge·-
neral, prepares to compel them by Force. They apply to Philip, who
readily sends them the Succours they defire, and takes them under his
Proteffion. To revenge this A& of Hostility, Diopythes makes a De·-
scent upon the Coasts of Thrace, then subje& to Macedonia : lays waste
the Country, and carries off a confiderable Booty. Philip, engaged in
his Thracian Expedition, sends> Ambaffadors to Athens to complain of
this Violation of the Peace concluded between thern, and to demand,
that Diopythes should be recalled and his Army disbanded. Our Orator
undertakes his Defence‚ and as he saw his Interest united With that of the
Public, he therefore defends him upon Principles of public Utility, and
with Asguments befitting the. Dignity of a great People. He represents.
him, and his Army, as their Country's best Security against Philip’s
Power and Ambition, which from thence become the principal Objee‘t}
of our Author's vehement Eloquence·

Demosthenes was nine and thirty Years of Age, when he pronounced
this Oration, in the third of the hundred and ninth Olympiad.
