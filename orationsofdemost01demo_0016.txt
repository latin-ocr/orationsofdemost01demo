fi ON THE POLITICAL STATE

IN the earliest Period of their History, the Grecians are in

Life by Rapine and Plunder. The Sea-Coasts were infested -
with Pyracies, the inland Country with Robberies. Their
Wars, however, were of short Continuance, for they had not

Country. As Foreigners and Strangers very seldom refided
among them, the original Inhabitants were more unmixed, and
the Descent of Families more exactly preserved. From hence,-
perhaps, their best Claim to the Vanity of being created with
the Sun, and Natives of the Soil. Undoubtedly, its natural
Sterility obliged them to the Labours of Agriculture, with
which the mechanica] Arts have a necessary Connexion. These(
Arts exercised, improved, and enlarged their Understandings.
The Paffions began to unfold themselves in artificial Wants.
A kind of Luxmy, frugal indeed and temperate, introduced

among them the first Sciences, that civilise Mankind. Indus-
