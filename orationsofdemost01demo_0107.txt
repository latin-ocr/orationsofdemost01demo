DEMOSTHEr-Jr-JS.

IT is generally said by the persons, who :3951133‘54 our sending Si. Δ -

the Recovery of Oropus; but that

our Enemy, who might assist us in such an Attempt, never

must expe& their Alliance hereafter.

That every Expedienc

should be exerted for the Recovery of Oropus, I heartily de-

clare ; but that the Lacedaenronians will now become our Ene-

mies, if we conclude an Alliance with the Arcadiam, who

make us an Offer of their Friendship, our Orators alone, who

persuaded us to affist them, when their Republic was in ex-

tremest Danger‚ Ι really think,

ought never to affert. (3) For

they, who argue in this Manner‚ are the very Persons‚ by whose

Counsels you rejeeked the whole People of Pehponnesuz, when

(3) The Sense of this Paffage appears
to L-ucchesmi a little obscure. It must
therefore well deserve to be explained.
They, who advised the Athenians to be
reconciled to the Lacedaemonians, and
to support them against Thebes, why
shall they alone be now forbidden to per-
suade them not to assist the Arcadians ?
To abandon this People would rather
seem to confirm their Reconciliation with
the Lacedaemonians. The Answer is
plain and dire& They must afr in Con-
tradiffion to those Principles‚ upon which
they advistd the Athenians to succour
the Lacedaemonians ; for it is now equally
their interest to hinder the Lacedaemo-

nians from conquering Arcadia, aq it was

then to preserve Sparta from being ruined
by the Thebans. Their true political
Interest should for ever prevent either of
these States from becoming too power·
ful.

Thus it was the Interest of the Lace‘
daemonians to assist the Athenians in re-
covering Oropus, because it was their
Interest to weaken‚ as much as possible,
the Power of the Thebans. What In-
fluence Gratitude may be supposed to
have upon the Condi-1& of States and
Princes, the Transsator will not presumo
to determine. It is at 'least a Subjee't for
Oratory, and as such our Orator hatb

used it.
