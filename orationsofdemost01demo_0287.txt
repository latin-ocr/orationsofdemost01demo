that Peace3 if in open Violation of that Peace he does not
forceably keep Poffeffion of our proper Territories; if he does
not arm all Mankind· against us, then certainly we should dc—
bate no more, but Peace should fimply be preferred and invio-
lably observed3 for which Advice Ι perceive you are all ex—

sailed for Chersonesus, Philip appears to have unjustly seized
upon several Places, which of Right belonged to us, witness
your own authentic Decrees, complaining of his Usurpations ; (1)
if at all other Times he hath constantly armed against you every‘
Nation, both Greeks and Barbarians, wherefote do we still de-
bate upon the Choice of Peace or War?( 2) But indeed no
