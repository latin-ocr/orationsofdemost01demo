Country, whenever there is Occasion. Nor have' I ever said,

that to these Doers of Nothing should be distributed those Re-
waids, which are due· to the Soldier, who shall a& for the
Sasety of the Republic3 nor that our Citizens should be so

idle, indolent, and ignorant, as meerly to have heard, that our

Auxiliaries under the Command of some certain General have
gained a complete Vi&ory. For these are our present Circum-
stances. Not that I blame whoever aeis with Courage in the Ser-

nian People to perform yourselveS, what you Honour in others,
and not to abandon, O Men of Athens, that Post of Virtue‚

which having gained by many and glorious Dangers your An-

cestors have transmitted to you their Descendants. Ι have now
nearly spoken what I think of general Utility. It is yours to
determine upon such Measures, as will be most advantageous

and honourable to you, and to the Republic.
