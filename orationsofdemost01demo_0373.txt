DEMOSTHENES. 299

in private Families I have never observed aYouth behaving hirn-
self in this Manner to his Elders; neither so totally devoid of
all Sentiments of Humanity, nor so perverse of Temper, as to
declare‚ he will not labour for the general Support of the Fa-
mily, unless his Parents bear an equa] Share of the Fatigue.
Such Behaviour would render him liable to the Penalties our
Laws inflia upon unnatural Children. For, in my Opinion,
a Child should punetually and chearfully pay the Portion allot-
ted both by Nature and the Laws for supporting his Parents in
their Indigence. As we have therefore, each of us, a Father‚
who claims our natural Duty and Affeeciom so should the whole
People be esteemed the common F athers of the Republic 3 and
so far from taking away by Violence whatever the Common-
wealth has appointed for their Support‚ that if there be no Pro-
vifion made, we should ourselves relieve their Neceffities. If
the rich would entertain these Sentiments‚ I am persuaded, they

would a& not only more equitably‚ but more for their own pe-

culiar Advantage. For to defraud the indigent of a necessary
Subfistence is to raise up Enemies against the Republic.

I WOULD now advise the poor to remove that Oppaeslion,
which lies hcavy upon the wealthy‚ and of which they not un-
reasonably complain. 1 shall proceed, as I have already done, '
nor hesitate to affert such Truths, as are favour-able to their

Cause. For'in my own Opini0n‚ there is not a Wretch so mi-
