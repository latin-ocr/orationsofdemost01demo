ORATION VIII.

Upon the 'Peace concluded with P H Ι L 1 P.

Very well perceive, O Men of Athens, that our Debates up·
on the present Situation of Affairs will be attended with ex-

ceeding Difficulty and Disorder3 not upon Account alone of the
many Places, we have yielded to the Enemy, and that all Advice

bly given to Demosthenes, and, if evcrs
pronounced in the third of th: hundred
and eighth Olympiad, when he was five
and thirty Years of Age.
