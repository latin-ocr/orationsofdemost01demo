ORATIONXIL

FOURTH·PH1LIPP<IC..

S I am persuaded the SubjeCr of your present Debatesj,

O Men of Athens, is of exceeding Importance, andl

even of absolute Neceflity to the very Being of the Common-

wealth, I shall endeavour to propose such MeasureSJeS I believe*

will be most conducive to your Interests„ But although the·

Errours of our Adnunistration, by which we are thus distreffed„

are neither few in Number, nor are they lately become thus-2

numerous, yet far more distressful is that inward Averfion youi

feel to the Bufiness of the Public, and that you can support,

Our Critics have not yet agreed whe-
ther the Repetition of Paffages taken from
his other orations, is a Fault or Excel-
lence in our Author: whether the same
Arguments are used more strongly to en-
force his Sense‚ and impl-ess it more
deeply upon the Minds of his Audience,
or whether they proceed from an exhaust-
ed Subjec't, and a tired Imagination. Mr.
Tourreil, in the natural Affection of a
Transsator for his Author‚ declares in
their Favour, and at once afferts both
the Art and Neceflity of using them thus

yOUI‘

frequently, when he cans this Philippicw
the Peroration of all< the former. Yet
perhaps it were a better Defence, and
certainly more impartial, to believe withv
the Scholiast, that our Orator was oblig-
ed, by some disagreeable News from:
Thrace, to speak extempore to the Peo«
ple. We may then conclude, that Re-
petitions so numerous, and of such<
Length, can ill deserve to be esteemed..
Beauties, although it be confessed the

Moderns in general are too delicate upon
this Subjeft.
