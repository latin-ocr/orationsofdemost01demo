Bauer while the Athenians indulged the Transports of their

Vicitory, Themistocles alone considered it, not as the End, but
the Beginning of their Wars with Perfia. Befides, he had
formed a generous Design of asserting the Independenee of his
Country‚ and no longer suffering her to continue under the
Dominion of Sparta. He was cautious to conceal these Senti-

ments from the People. Such a Defign, if publicly known, would

have been treated as a vifionary Project‚ or rather a crimina] In-
tention of kindling a War between the two Nations. How-
ever, there was no other poffible Method of carrying it into
Execution‚ than by rendering the Athenians equally superior to

the Lacedaemonians at Sea, as they were inferior in their Forces

at Land. He therefore took Advantage of the present Inso-

lence of the People, arifing from their late Victory‚ to engage

them, under the Pretext of some ancient Injuries, in a War
with the AEginetes‚ the most considerable maritime Power of

Greece.
