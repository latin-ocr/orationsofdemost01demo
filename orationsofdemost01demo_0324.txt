and Inaffion, if you will even yet a& as your Interests demand„

Misfortunes, is the best with Regard to our future Hopesz -What
Circumstance? That by your never having pursued, in any one
Instance‚ whether of less or greater Importance, the real In·
terests of the Republic, you are now in this unhappy Situation„

attention 3 over the Republic he hath gained no Vietory. Yott
have not been conquered3 you have not even marched' to Bat-

have only to propose and advise the safest, eafieft Methods- of being

revenged. But finceamong our own Citizens there are some so.
