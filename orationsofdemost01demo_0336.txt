‚262 ORATIONSOF

moPylae, and all the Paffages into Greece, does he not keep
Pofl‘eflion of them by Garrisons and a mercenary Soldiery ? He
holds a Prerogative of consulting, before any others, the Ora-
cle of Apollo, having excluded us, the Dorians, Thestaliam,
and other Amphictyon& a Prerogative‚ of which the Grecians
in general did not participate. He prescribes to the Theffalians
in what Manner they should form their Government. He
sends his mercenary Troops into Porthmus to drive out the Ere-
trians ; and into Oreum, to establish the Tyrant Philistides.
The Grecians however behold these Wrongs 3 they suffer them3
like People, in my Opinion, who behold a Storm of Hail, and
implore the Gods to avert the Tempest from falling upon their
Lands‚ but never attempt to prevent the Desolntion, with which
it descends. Not only does not any one revenge the common In—
sults offered to Greece3 but even not rescnt hia <mvn peculias
Injuries. Surely this the last Extra—me of Ignominy. Hath -he
not invaded Leucas and Ambracia3 Cities belonging to the Co-
sinthians? When he had violently wrested Naupactus from the
Achaim-12, did he not swear to deliver it to the AEtolians? Hath
he not dispoflkffed the Thebans of Echinus? Is he not even
now marching against the Byzantines, and are they not our
Allics? Other lnstances of his Injustice and Usurpations I omit.
Yet, at this very Moment‚ he continues in Poffeffion of Cardia,
the capital City of Chersonesus. Yet while we suffer these In-

dignities³
