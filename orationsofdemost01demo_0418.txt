ORATAIONXIVL'

On the s'TATE of the REPUBLm.

· ITH Regard to the Money at present under your De-

bates, and whatever Circumstances relating to it, for

which you have convened this Affembly, neither of these Con-

* sequences, O Men of Athens, in my Opinion, should be re-

presented as unreasonable ς either that they, who blame the Di-

stributions of our public Funds, should be greatly applauded by

the Citizen8‚ who deem such Distributions prejudicial to the ⁶

Commonwealth3 or on the contrary, that whoever approves

of,

This Oration is.n0t mentioned by Di· Defign, but in the following Oration he

onylius‚ from whence it is difficult to as-
certain the Time in which it was pro-

nounced. Lucchefini, with much Pro-
babilsty, places it after all the Philippics·,

after Philip had raised the Sicge of By-
zantium, and concluded a Peace 'with
the Athenians3 certainly after the three
Olynffiiacs, because in the first our Ora-
tor cautioussy and obrem-ely mentions the
Appropriation of the theatrica} Money
to the military Funds. In the third, he
clearly disclairns all Intention of such a

boldly and openly afferts the Neceffity of
such an Expedient. Philip next Year
made himself Master of Elataea by Sur·
prize, and threatened to march into the
Ten-itories of Athens. The Neceffity-
of this Appropriation then appeared in
a stronger Lighn than even our Author’s
Eloquence was able to place it. The
People instantly decreed all the Revenues‘
of the Commonwealth to the Support
of the War, and Demosthenes had the
Honour of Writing their Decree.
