TheARGUMENT.

Ε LATED by some favourable News from Olynthus, the Atheni-
ans now talk of denouncing War against Philip, and taking Ven-
geance for all his Injuries and Insults. Our Orator endeavours to sup-
press this Intemperance 3 is apprehensive, they may look upon this Ad-
vantage‚ gained by the Olynthians‚ as a complete Vi&ory and, negleffit
sending them any greater Succours ; proposes the true Q-estion for their
Debates‚ not Vengeance, but the Proteffion of their Allies. He then
enters, with much more Boldness‚ into the Consideration ef the Sums
expended in their theatrica] Entertainments. Offers a Plan for their fu-
ture Regulation. The Adv‘antages arifing from such a Plan. Every
Motive of Interest and Glory is urged for carrying it into Executima,
particularly that Glory, bequeathed to them by their Ancestors.
