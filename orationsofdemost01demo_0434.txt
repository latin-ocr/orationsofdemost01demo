lhould read your Decrees, and then regularly confider your
Aetions ᾗ] Consequence of those DecreeS‚ could hardly believe
they proceeded from the same People. Witness the Spirit,
with which you decreed to march against the execrable Megare-
3113)(9) who had seized the Lands belonging to Ap01103 to
hinder their sacrilegious Poffeffion, nor ever suffer such Impiety.
*Witness your DecreeS, when the extremest Miseries had fallen
upon the Phliafians, powerfully to succour them, nor abandon
them to the Cruelty of their ExecutionerS, but to encourage
the Pelopounefians, whoever were willing, to affist them. Glo-
rious indeed, O Men of Athens, and just all these Decreee,
and worthy of the Republic3 but the Aetions that ssmuld have
attended them, never appeared. Thus have you provoked the
general Indignation of Greece, for you never have support-
ed these Decrees even by one generous Effort. They were in-
deed worthy of the Majesty of the Comlnonwealth, but your
Forces were by no Means proportioned to what you decreed.
⁷ I would therefore earnestly advise you (nor let any one be angry
with me) either to form less magnificent Defigns, and to be
contented to restraiu them within their proper Bounds, or to

prepare a larges Force to carry them into Exeeution.
