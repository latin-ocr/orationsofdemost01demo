DEMOSTHENES.

Yoo ssiould next with Confidence recolleet, both what you

have heard from others, and what you may remember you
yourselves have seen, how formidable a Power the Lacedaemo-
nians not long since poffeffed, (5) and how generoussy‚ how
confistently with the Dignity of your Chara&er‚ you then a&-

ed ; not in any one Particular unworthy of the Republic, but
supporting, in Defence of the common Rights of Greece, the
whole Weight of the War against them. Why do I mention

these Instances ? That you may be convinced‚ O Men of Athens,

that nothing is capable of alarming you, while you are atten-

by recolleffing how glorioussy they had
vindicated the common Cause of Greece,
and recovered their own Liberty frorn the
Tyranny and Oppreffion of the Lacedae-
monians.

Wolfius, in a Note upon the Word
’προσ-ἥκοντως, gives us this glorious Cha-
racter of the Athenians; that their City

was always open, as a common Affylum,
to the afflicted and distreffed.

(5) A Description of this Power by
Diodorus may not be disagreeable, or
unuseful to the Reader. At this Time
the Lacedaemonians poffeffed their highest
Power‚ and held the Sovereignty of Greece,
both by Sea and Land. The Thebans
were controuled by a Garris0n3 the Co-
rinthians and Argives broken and de-
preffed by their former Wars ; the Athe-
nians, by submitting as if they were
conquered, were disesteemed by the States

of Greece. On the contrary, the Lace·
daemonians had a numerous Army·, were
most attentive to the War, and univer-
sally formidable. The greatest Princes
of that Age (I mean the King of Persia,
and the Tyrant of Sicily, Dionysius) re-
vered the Arms of the Spartans, and cul-
tivated their Friendship. Lib. 15·

The Lacedaemonians abused their Pow-
er; the Thebans revolted‚ and implored
the Affistance of Boeotia3 the Boeotian
War was declared ·‚ the Athenians en-
tered into the Confederacy with Vigour·²
their Germ-als, Iphicrates and Caliias, de·
feated the Lacedaemonians at Corinth,
and Chabrias gained an important Vic-

tory over thern at Sea. The Battle of ’

Corcyra soon followed, and Timotheus,
the Year after, conquered them at Leu-
cas. TouRRtiL.
