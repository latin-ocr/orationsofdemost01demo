When you have repealed these Laws, and thus opened a Way
in Safety to better Counsels‚ then inquire for some Orator, whr)
shall propose a Decree unanimoussy acknowledged beneficia] to

to find a Man, who by proposing that Advice to you most ad-
vantageous‚ is willing to suffer Death by you sor propofiug ir,

Funds to the Support of the The—atre,
which had been destined to the Mainte-
nance of their Fleets and Armies, they
suffered their military Laws to be treated
with Contempt‚ and violated with Im-
punity. Desertion in the private Soldier,
and Cowardice in the General, which
once· were punishecl with Deam, were
hardly considered now as Matters of Re-
proach. Can we then wonder, that they
were betrayed and sold by their Orators,
their Admirals and their Generals ? That
they were conquered and enssaved by

Philip3 or, indeed, were they wortlry of
a better Face ?

We have already said, in the Notes οη
the last Oration, Eubulus had enasted a
Law, that made it punissiable with Death
to propose a Decree for the Alienation
of the military Funds, which lic then
appropriand to the Theatre. The rc-
peal of this Law is now the great l’ur— ‚
pose of our Orator, and we may cou-
clude, from his Manner of mentioning
it, that it was only capital to propoli? a
dire& and formal Decree for repealing it.
