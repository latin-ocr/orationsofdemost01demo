present Condition? Hath he not ruined her Cities, and abso-
lutely taken away her very Constitution of Government?
Hath he not established a Tetrarchy over her, that he may en—
ssave not Cities only, but Nations? Are not the Republics of
Euboea subdued to his Tyrants? Does not this Issand border
upon Thebes and Athens? Does he not expressy write in his
Letters‚ ‘⁴ I ssuaH continue in Peace with them, who are will-

nnce against him, nor express our own particular Indignation.
