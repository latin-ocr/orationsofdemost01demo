314 (ORATTONSOF‘

ΒΗΤ some of your Orators, in their very different Condu& of
their own and your Affairs, neither a& with a. Regard to equal
and impartial Reason, nor that Integrity becoming a Citizen of
Athens. How canv itepoffibly be reasonable, that escaping out
of your public Goals they should be totally ignorant: of them-
selves, while a? Republic, that held, till now, the foremost
Rank among the Grecian States‚ and formerly poffeffed
the Sovereignty of Greece, should fink into the deepest Obscu-
rity and Ignominy? But although Ι have much to say upon-
this, and many other Subjersts, yet I forbear 3 fince not from a
Penury of Advice, as I conceive, have either your. past, or do

your present Distreffes asise, but when you have heard, and,
unanimoussy approved of any MeasureS, as rightly and judici-
oussy proposed, yet you fit with equal Attention to hear the
Counsels of otherS, who purpose only to prevent the Execution
of those MeasureS, or wholly to pervert the Reasoning, upon·
which they are founded. Not that you. are ignorant of their-
Charadstrs, for you can instantly distinguish, whoever speaks
sor his Reward, and supports the Interests of Philip, and who-
ever offers his Advice with equal Integrity as Wisdom3 but
when these faithful Advisers are accused, you turn the Pro—se-

cution into Raillery and Invefflve, yet never, in any one Instance‚
discharge your Duty to your Country.
