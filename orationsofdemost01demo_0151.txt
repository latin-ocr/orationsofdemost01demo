DEMOSTHENES. 77,-·

Decrees with Honour and Advantage to the Commonwealth,
nor be longer influenced by frivolous and idle Colljee'tures. For

it does not concern you to look into F uturity, but to b'e well

affured, that whatever is in F uturity, will be to you most mi-
semble, if you be not more attentive to the Administration‚ and.

more afflve in the Execution, of your Affairs.

W1TH Regard to myself‚ never. did I at any Time endea„
vour to please you, when Ι spoke, unless I was persuaded my
Advice was'[equally as useful as agreeable. I have now given
you my Sentiments with Freedom3 all of them with perse&

Simplicity, and without Apprehenfion of your Displeasure.
Yet as I am convinced, it is of* utmost Importance. to you to

hear the best Advice, so Ι fincerely wish, it were of Advan-
tage to the Person, who proposes it. I should then have spo-

ken with much greater Pleasure. But although it be doubtful
and uncertain, in what Manner I may be affeeted by the Mea-
sures I have proposed, yet persuaded that it was your Interest

to execute, I determined to propose them. May that. Opinion
prevail, whatever will be most beneficia} to yon, and the Rea
public.
