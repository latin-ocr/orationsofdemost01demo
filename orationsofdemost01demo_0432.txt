258 ’ ORATIONS OF

the Subfidies paid by our Allies? Those very Allies‚ whom we

gained during the War, have not our Ministers despoiled us of
during the Peace ? (7)

ΒΗΤ, by the Gods, in these Instances alone was their Ad-
ministration superior to the present ; in all others is it not much
inferior ? Far otherwise. But let usexamine whatever Part you
please of Jthe Republic„ Edifices and public Ornaments of the
City, of our Temples and our Harbours, our Ancestors have
left us so splendid and magnificent, that no Poffibility of ex-
ceeding them remained to their Posterity. Portico3, Arsenals,
Arcaydes, and other Works are still existing, with which they
adorned the City, and which they have bequeathed to us. Yet
the private Dwellings of the Persons at that Time in Power,
were so moderate, so agreeable to the Charaeter of a popular
Government, that whoever knows the Houses of Themistocles,
Cimon, Aristides, Miltiades and others, the illustrious of that
Age, will perceive them nothing more elegant οι· magnificent,
than those of their Neighbours. At present, the City is abun-
dantly contented among her public WorkS, to have repair-

ed our Streets‚ our Fountains„ our Walls, and our Aque-

duets.
