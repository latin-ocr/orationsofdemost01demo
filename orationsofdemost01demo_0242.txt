Would you then, Demosthene3‚ appropriate this Money to the

military Fund? (24) YeS‚ and instantly, to every Rank, O

Men of Athens 3 to every Order of our Citizens, that each

Man, receiving his Dividend of what belongs in common to

all, when the Republie shall have Oceafion for his Service, may

Imitations of this Image are incontestable
Proofs of its Force and Elegance, and
Beauty. The inhumari Tiberius proba-

thrown a noble Roman into Prison, he
ordered the Jailer to give him only such
a Qam‘uy, and such Kind of Nourish-
ment, as should afford him neither
Strength nor Pleasm-e, yet ssiould hindei·
him from dying. Let the Horrors of
this execrable Story alarin every free
People to an Attention to the first At-
tempts against their Liberty. For what
Nation now upon Earth can presume to
say, they would submit only to any
certain Degree of Slavery, when the Ro-
man People could be thus enssaved to
the C ruelty of Tiberius, the Madness of

preserved, nor the Words faithfully ren-
