xlii ΟΝ ΤΙ-ΙΕ POLITICAL STATE

Deaffl, are strong Presumptions in Favour of his Innocence.
And whatever Contraditfffions or Oppofitions of Vice and Vir-
tue too frequently appear in the same Charaecer, yet is it most
difficolt to conceive, that a Nobleness of Sentiments‚ and a
Dignity of thinking almost peculiar to him, and constantly
maintained in all his Orations, could debase itself to the Vile-

ness of Venality and Corruption.

Tffls little Vindication of a favourite Author will be for-
given. It was due to Justice and History ; to Virtue and hu-
man N ature3 for when a great Charaeter can thus shamefully

debase itself, our common Humanity feels the Reproach, and

Virtue herself is dishonoured.

HERE the Reader may perhaps be pleased to stop, and look
back upon the politica] Country through which he hath tra-
velled. He harh seen the Principles‚ upon which Athens and
Sparta were founded. In Imitation of these two great Repub-

lics‚ or under their Influence and Power‚ all the less confider-
able States of Greece were formed. He must be convinced,
that the Happiness of Society arises from Virtue, as in a regu-
lar, unvaried Course of Nature, and that Misery is the certain'
Produce of Vice‚ whether private or public· By the uncor-
rupted Spirit of their Magistrates 3 by the Courage of their Ci-

tizens
