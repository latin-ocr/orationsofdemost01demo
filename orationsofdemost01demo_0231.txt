DEMOSTHENES.

CoNsmER them therefore, O Men of Athens, in their pro-

per Nature, and you will then be able to send an Army into
the F ield, and raise'a F und for its Pay. Neither is it the Cha-

raeter of a wife, or genereus Nation to desert a War for Want

of Supplies, and patiently to bear such Indignities as we have

suffered 3 nor consistent with that charae-tter to take up Arms

with so much Ardour and to march against the Corinthians and

Megareans, yet suffer Philip to enssave the Cities of Greece,

· by neglefflng to provide the proper Subsistence for your Sol-

diery. (1 3)

(13) That we may better determine

f what War Demosthenes means ζ for the

Athenians had maintained more than one
against the Corinthians and Megareans)
we should endeavour to find that particu—
lar vWar, which may give his reasoning
the Spirit of Example, and animate the
present People, by the F orce of the Com-
parison, to succour the Olynthians against
Philip, as their Ancestors had affisted
some other Nations against the C orin-
thians and Megareans. The Paffige
otherwise is a vague and vain-glorious
Piece of History.

Corinth and Corcyra had entered into
a VVar for the Poffeffion of Epidamnum,
which each of them claimed as their proper
Colony. The AthenianS, although in Al-
liance with the Corinthiam, supported
’ the CorcyraeanS, and sent them confider-
able Succours. The Corinthians thus
expostulate with them on the Occafion.

NOR

Yon (252 unjustly, O siden of Ahens, in thus
committing Hostilities agaitfi us, and vio-
lating the Treaties between us. For ifyou

be rqsclved to hinder our making a Descent ’

upon Corcyra, we declare you have dffolved
the Alliance between us, and [reat us like
Enemies. Tnvcvo. Lib. I. Thus full
and dire& to the Point is this Exmple,
nor less direct, perhaps, is the Athenian
Expedition against the Corinthiam, men—
tioned by the same Author. The Mega-
νείκης, distreffi’d by the Corinthiam, revolt—
ed from the Lacedaemoniam, and entered into
an Alliance with the Athenians, who buil!
a Wall for them from their Cfity [ο the Ha-
ven‚ and placed a Garrrson in it ostheir own
Troops. From hence arose tlnc violent En»
mity between· Corinth and Athens.

We may believe the other Instance,
with Regard [othe Megareans, is equally
strong and conclusive to his Design of
