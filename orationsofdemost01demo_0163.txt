DEMOSTHENEs. 89

was in their Power to enter, upon equal Terms, into an Alli-
ance with the Greciam, and with this Repubhc, the most pow—
erful State of Greece, they chose rather to be enssaved by Bar—
barians and Slaves, whom they admitted into their Citadel. (9)
Yet I could almost venture to affirm, if you now determine to
succour them, their past Misfortunes may be greatly beneficial
to them. For had they prospered under the Alteration of their
Constitution, Ι know not whether they would ever have return-
ed to wiser Counsels, being, as they are, truly Rhodians. (10)
But since they are now better instrueted, and convinced by Ex—

perience‚

(9) The Troops of Artemisia, which
they received into their C itadel.

(ιο) Homer calls them insolent‚ ὑπερ-
ηφάνες. Livy mentions the Foolissme‘ss
of their Pride‚ stolida-e superbiae3 a Cha-
rafter they still maintain even in the
Wretchedness of a Turkish Slavery. But
oni· Orator, while he is pleading for their
Preservafion, why does he thus industri-
oussy set their Eri-oms in these strong
Lights ?

The Transsator hath almost resolved
never to make any of the usual Remarks
of Praise and Admiration upon the Art
or condiret, or that Force of reasoning‚
peculiar to his Author. To a sensible
Reader it is impertinent 3 to an unfeeling
it is useless. Yet it may be sometimes
not unneceffary to awaken his Attention,
as perhaps in this particular Instance.
Our Orator had undertaken avery un-
popular Cause‚ for the Rhodians had di-

stinguissied themselves, in the late socia}
War, by their Opposition to the Atheni-
ans. Demosthenes therefore does not
oppose the popular Resentment; he joins
with the People in their Indignation, and
represents the Rhodians in the most odi—
ous Colours of Pride, Perfidy, f'oolish- v
ness and Injustice. Yet however unwor-
thy, in themselves, of that Protec‘tion
they implore, they are Objefis of that
Generoffly, which had ever distinguished
the Republic of Athens, and in which ssie
had always placed her highest Glory ; that
of forgiving Injuries committed against
her, and proteriting the oppreffed. To Sen-
tirnents of this elevated Spirit, and to

these Motives of Glory‚ our Orator adds ,

those of Interest, by proving how much
it imported the State of Athens to assist

a democratical Republic‚ and not to
abandon an Issand so powerful, as that of

Rhodes, to their Enemies.
