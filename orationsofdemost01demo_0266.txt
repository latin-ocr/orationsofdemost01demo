ORATIONS OF

¹192
every {nveffive pronounced against Philip is received with uni—
versal Approbation. Yet nothing, if l may be allowed the
Expreffi0n3 (2) nothing of lmportance harh been executed 3 not
any one Measure for whose Sake alone these Orations could me-
rit your Attention. But indeed to such extreme Distress are the
Affizirs of this Republic unhappily reduced, that in Proportion
as we more abundantly, more evidently prove, that Philip hath
violated the Treaty between us, and is at this Moment form—
ing Defigns against the universal Interests of Greece, so much

more difficule is it to advise what Measures we ought to pursue.

BUT all these Difficulties arise- from this one Cause alone,
that Princes, like Philip, ambitious of extending their Domi-'
nions, must be opposed, O Men of Athens, by War, and Ac-

tions, not by Words and Arguments. Yet we, who appear on

this Tribunal, are unwilling to propose Decrees or offer our
Advice, in Apprehenfion of your Displeasure 3 but all his Ac—

tions, atrocious and oppressive‚ and meriting every other Epi-

thet

lations humane. KVere it not better to
confess onr Ignorance of the precise Ideas
in an Author, than transsate thus literally
and unintelligibly? However, the pre-
sent Transsator frankly acknowledges his
own Uncertiinty, and only hopes the
Expreffion he hath chosen, filled with
Sentimmls of exi-&edingr Mederation (which
are generally inspssred by a Philanthropy
1

or Love of Kind) will best agree with
the Sense of the Context.

(2) Ὠςὲπος ἔιπεῗν, transsated by Wol-
fius and his Editors ut ingenue dicam;
surely very differently from the Meaning
of the Words, which fignify in all Aua
thors, ut uno verbo dicam ς ut ita dicanw,

ut ita dixerim. Lucchefini transsates
them, ut brevi completJar.
