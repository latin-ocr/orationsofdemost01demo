imagine, while he neither receives any Appointments from you,
nor has any of his own to pay his Forces, from whence does
he maintain them ? Is their Subfistence from Heaven? Impos-
fible. Whatever he collects from these Contributions ; what-
ever he can beg, or borrow upon Usury, these are the Supplies,
by which with Difficulty he maintains his Troops. His Accus-
ers therefore in Effe& only declare to all Mankind, that you

ought not to affign him any Appointments, but consider him
as a Man, who will soon be prosecuted‚ not only for Crimes

which he 113111 already committed, but which he 111311 commit
hereafter. Such is the Tendency of their Clarnour83 “ He
“ proposes to form a Siege: he will expose the Afiatic Greeks
“ to the Enemy.” Are they indeed thus anxious for these
Afiatic Greeks? Then certainly they feel a greater Concern for
the Interests of Foreigners, than of their native Country‚ and
from hence their Earnestness to send another General to the

Hellespont. For if Diopythes be guilty of any Enormitie83 if

’ he commits any Acts of Pyracy‚ 3 little Mandate, O Men of

Α1116115, 3 little Mandate will effectually repress 311 future Dis-
orders.
