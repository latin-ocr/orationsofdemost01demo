unimportant ConquestS, in an idle Magnificence of Buflding,
and a Profufion of Expcnce in theatrica] Entertainments. Thus

Monarchy, and her Attention to the Constitution diffipated in
critical Disquifitions upon Poetry, Mufic, Sculpture and Paint-

by corrupting her Citizens 3 for Gold had now gained Admis-
fion into Sparta3 the Laws of Ἰ Lycurgus had lost a great Part

of their original Influence, and the Constitution began to feel
the direful Effens of Venality and Corruption.

YET the Condu& of Pericles was, in another Instance, still
more pernicious to the Republie. Whether in an unhappy Va·
nity of appearing able to execute‚ in his own Person, all the
great Offiees of the Commonwealth 3 or from a Jealousy with
Regard to his Power (for to this Paffion even the greatest Spi-
rits are liable) he removed from the Administration whoever
were eminently capable of serving their Country, and affumed
to himself the sole Direffion of the Navy, the Army, and the
Treasuxy. By this Conducst he left the Republic, at his Death‚
to be governed by the Temerity of Cleon, the Timidity of Ni·-
