308 ORATIONSOF

yourselves will dire& that Vengeance, due to their own Perffiiy,
against the Citizen, who harh spoken with Integrity and Zeal
in your Defence. Such are the Hopes of these Betrayers; such
the Foundation of their Clamours, “< That' certain Persons
“ would involve us in a War.'' Yet this I certainly and clearly
know, that before any one Athenian proposed a Decree sor com.-
mencing Hostilities, Philip had already made himself Master of
numerous Places under the Obedience of the Republic, and
that he lately sent Succours to. the Cardians. If however we
are obstinate in diffembling, that he hath actuaLly begun the
VVar, he were of all Mankind the weakest, if he convinced us
of our Errour. When they, who are injured, deny the Wrongs
they have received, what befits the Person who committed them ?
But when in very Fa& he marches hither to invade us, what
ssmll we say then? Affuredly he never will acknowledge the In·-
vafion an A& of Hostility, as he never made any such Acknow-
ledgment to the Oritans, when his Troops were even encampe-
ed within their Territories 3 nor to the Pheraeans, until he had
actually made an Affault upon their Walls3 nor,¹ in ther Begirg-
ning of his Depredations, to the Olynthians, until he appeared
in Person with an Army amidst their Dominions. Even then
{hall we declare, that they, who encourage us to repel this In»-
vader, are Authors of the War? The Remainder then is 813-
very. No other poffible Medium.
