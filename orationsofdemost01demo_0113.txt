DEMOSTHENES. 39

their Ambinon, while they held that Sovereignty‚ those you
better know perhaps than I dO, and may therefore remember

them with greater and juster Apprehenfion. (7)

YET I would gladly ask our Orators‚ some of whom profess
to hate the Thebans, and some the Lacedaemoniam, whether
they really hate, whom they profess to hate, for your Sake‚
and for your Interest, or whether they mutually· hate the The-
bans to gratify the Lacedaemonians‚ and the Lacedaemoniam toz
gratify the Thebans, (8) If these the Motives of their Advice,
by neither of them, as if they were aetuated by their Paffions

even to Madness, should you suffer yourselves. to· be persuaded.

(7) Our Orator again, andin the same
covert Mamer, expreffes his Apprehen-
fions of the growing Power of the La-
cedaemonians. He strongly alarms his
Audience with the Calamities they may
justly expe& from the future Sovereignty
of that People‚ by recollefflng their past
Insolence and Tyranny. They had com-
pelled the Athenians to destroy the Py-
raeum; tov raze the Waus, which joined
that Harbour to the city, and to fol—
low, either by Land or Sea, the Stand-
ards of Lacedaemon. They changed
their Form of Governrnent, and irn-
posed thirty Tyrants upon them.

Our Orator was not then born, but
many of his Audience must have re-
membered these Instances of the pride,
and Ambition, and Tyranny of the La-

cedaemonians, only one and fifty Years
before this Oration was spoken.

(8) Ἱ-Ιὸἑως ἅν πυθοίμην τῶν λεγόν·
των κοὶι τὲς Θηβαιές μισ-εῖν φασκόντων,
κοὶι τῶν τὲς Λακεδαιμονίης, πότεροι dn*
ἑκάτεροι μισ-ἕσιν, ἔς δὴ μισ-ἕσιν, ὑπὲρ
ὑμεῖν, &c. These Expreffions are not,
as Wolfius construes thern, to be under-
stood conjumffively, but disjunfflvely2 as.
ἑκάτεροι must fignify alterutri. This
appears from the Repetition of μισ-ἕσιν
and from the Contexr. Our Orators-
boasted their Hatred of the People against.
whom they spoke, and Demosthenes art-- ‚
fully remarks this boasting, to engage»
them to acknowledge from what Causes,
of Bribery and Corruption‚ their Hatredz
could proceed. Luccnzsmn.
