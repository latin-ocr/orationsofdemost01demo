imminent Danger, dispute with us the H'onour of commanding

Place of Congress to treat of Peace 3 while others have deter-
mined to rely upon their ‘own Strength‚ rather than upon your
Alliance. But wherefore do I menti0n3 wherefore do I repeat
our Misfortunes? It is not from an Inclination‚ I dare appealto
Jupiter and all our Deities, of becoming anv Obje& of your
Dispkaffive, but that every Citizen amongyou may behold2and‘
be convinced, that as in private Life, so in a public Admini-
strafion, our daily Remi-ssness and Indolencedo not immediately
make themselves sensibly felt in each particular Neglect, but„¹

they glaringly appear in the Sum total of our Affairs.

REFLECT, for- Instance, upon the Importance of Serrium and·
Doriscum (for these were· the first Places you negle&ed imme-
diately after the Ratification of the Peace) whose Names, per-

haps, are unknown to many in this Affembly‚ yet your Care-
lessness and Negledt of these Places occasioned the Loss of

Thrace, and the Ruin of Chei·sobleptes‚ your Ally. When
