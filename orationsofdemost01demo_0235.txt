DEMOSTHENES.

Dmniuion, as it becomes Barbarians to acknowledge the Domi—

nion of Grecians. (16) Many and glorious Trophies they ere-ft-

ed for Vi&ories, gained in their own Persons, both by Land

and Sea3 (17) while they alone of all Mankind have left to

their Posterity‚ a Reputation superior to Envy.

Such were

they with Regard to the general Administration of Greece·

entered into a Confederacy‚ at the Head
⁴of which, with many honourable Distine-
tions of Pre-emineme, they placed the
People ofAthens. Aristides, from their
·Opinion·of his Integrity, was appointed
to regulate the Proportion of Money‚
which every State should pay towards
raifing a common F und to repel any fu-
ture Invasion of the perflans. This Mo-
ney amounted annually to four hundred
fixty Talents‚ and was lodged in Apol-
lo’s Temple at Delos. But the Atheni-
ans grew insolent, alsused their Power,
transferred the Treasury from Delos to
Athens·, employed it to support their

· own VVars, and exaCted from the Con-

federates, the Proportion they had agreed
to pay, not as a voluntary Contribution,
but as a Tribute. However‚ we may
compute the Time in which they held
this honourable Sovereignty over the Gre-
cians, from the fourth of the seventy-
fifth Olympiad, when Mardonius was
defeated, to the nineteenth of the Pelo-
ponnefian VVar. This Per-iod includes
full fixty-four Years; and a few Months,
which we may suppose before the Confe-
dtrates totally deserted the Athenians,

Now

give the Nurnber of Years mentioned by
our Author.

(ιό) These Sentiments of Superiority‚
and this Clairn of Dominion over the
rest of Mankind‚ were almost natural to
the Grecians in general, but with higher
Insolence to the Athenians. Their Ora-
tors‚ their Poets and Philosophers, were
equally possefled with this Spirit of Ar-
rogance. Yet, with Regard to the In-
stance before ωε, some of the Predeces-
sors of Philip, probably Amyntas and>
Perdiccas, were really tributary to Athens.
However, we must believe the Fa& up-
on the sole Authority of Our Author.
Itis not mentioned by any of the Greci-'
an Historians.

(17) The Wars of Greece‚ in general,
were declared for Glory, not Extent of
Dominions. The principal Care there-
fore of the Conquerors was to ere& a
Trophy upon the F icld of Battle, if the
Vietory was gained at Land ·‚ isat Sea, on
the oppofite Shore‚ and the Law of Na-
tions sorbad the Euerny to oppose them,
if it was afterwards in their Power. 'l'he
Athenian Trophies were almost as nume-
rous, as the Battles they fought.
