of Ambition broke its Constitution. After the Defeat of Xer-
xes, the Lacedaemonians demanded the Expulfion of those De-
puties, whose Cities had deserted the Cause of Greece, and
enlisted under the Bannets of the Barbarians. Themistocles
strenuoussy opposed this Demand, in Apprehenfion‚ that if the
Argives, Theffalians and Thebans, People devoted to the In-

terests of Athens, were expelled, the Lacedaemonians would

become too powerful in the Number of Sus-frages, and govern
the Deliberations of the Affembly.

MANY different causes concurred to promote that Union,
which the Council of Amphydtions had inspired, but which,
by the Nature of their Constitution‚ they were incapable of
maintaining. Among these Causes may be reckoned an ancient
Custom of sending Colonies to Italy and Afia, when the Peo-
ple grew too numerous for their several Cities. These large
Detachments weakened the MothepCOuntries, and might better
have been employed in conquering some neighbouring Territo-
ries, which would have added to their Power, and been a kind
of Rampart to their hereditary Dominions. Such was the Po-
licy of the ancient Romans. We may venture to affert, that
Colonies founded upon Ideas of Grandem and Extent of Em-
pire, cannot be too nea-r, or those of Commeroe, too distant
from their Capital. The Distance promotes Navigation‚ and
even the Difference of Climates occafions new Demands either

of Luxury or Neceffity. H
