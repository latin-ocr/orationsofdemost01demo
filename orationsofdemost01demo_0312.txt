238 ORATIONsoF

supporting the Cause of Enemies is allowed. Whoever receives
from Philip the Price of Corruption, may with Impunity turn
Orator in his Favour, even in the Moment, when he is plun-
dering you of your proper Dominions. In Olynthus it was
dangerous to declare for him, until the greater Part of the
Olynthians were themselves influenced by the advantageous Ces—
fion of Potidaea. Nor in Theffaly was it safe to undertake the
Cause of Philip, while the Multitude of the Theffalians were
not yet affected towards him by their Gratitude for his expelling
their Tyrants, and restoring to them their Right of sending De- ⁸
puties to Thermopylae. In Thebes it was equally dangerous,
before he had ceded Boeotia, and absolutely destroyed the Pho-
caeans. But in Athens, although Philip hath not only despoil-
ed us of Amphipolis, and Cardia, with all its Dependancies,
but fortified Euboea, from whence to infest your Coasts, and
awe your future Operations; although he is aetually upon his
March to befiege Byzantium, yet there are in Athens, who
with Impunity patronize the Actions of Philip. Hence it pro-
ceeds, that some of your Orators from very Penury are sud-
denly become rich ·‚ from being nameless and unknown, are il-
lustrious and distinguished 3 while, on the contrary, the People
of Athens, from being once illustrious‚ and rich in Reveuues,
are now become indigent and inglorious. For the Treasures of
,a State, in my Judgement, are its Allies, its Honour‚ and the

Wisdom
