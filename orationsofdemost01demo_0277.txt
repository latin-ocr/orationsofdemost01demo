DEMOSTHENES. 203

‘⁶ THERE are by Jupiter (thus Ι told them) various Inven-
“ tions for the Defence and Preservation of Cities; such as
“ Ramparts, and Walls, and Trenches„ and other Fortifica-
“ tions. All these are of human Labour, and require a large
“ Expence to maintain them. But Nature hath for wife Men

⁴‘ provided one certain common Bulwark, of universal Excel-
“ lence and Security, especially for popular Governments

“ against Monarchs. What is this Bulwark? Diffidence. This

‘⁶ defend3 adhere to it; preserve it, and never shall you suf-
“ fer any Misfortune. What therefore, I asked them, do you
“ most ardently defire? Liberty? Yet do you not perceive‚
“ that Philip hath even his Titles most foreign from that N ame?
“ For every Monarch, every Sovereign is an Enemy to Liber-
“ ty, and an Opposer of Laws. Will you not be cautious
“ (thus I concluded) that while you earnestly wish to be deli-

“ vered from the Calamities of War, you may not find a des-
“’ potic Master ?”

THE Meffenians heard, and with loud Acclamations ap-
plauded what I said, as truly and judicioussy spoken. They
heard many other Orations made by the Ambaffadors‚ while 1
was present, and, probably, after my Departure, yet they
neither renounced their Alliance with Philip, nor their Dess

peudance on his Promises.
