DEMOSTHENES. '313

tainly best Answer, and we should admit the Truth of it, that
you acted only from a laudable Ambition and Love of Glory,
yet I really stand amazed, that while you esteem it your Duty,
from these MotiveS, to enter into such EngagementS, equally
laborious as dangerOUS, you can, however, advise the Common-
wealth indolently to abandon her Principles of afflug, her
Glory and Ambition. You will not affert the N eceffity of your
appearing eminently conspicuous in the Republic, yet hold it
unnecessary for the Republic to affume among the Greeians her
'ust Authority. Neither do I conceive, when the Safety of the
Commonwealth demands her confining herself to her-own pro-
per Affairs, yet for you it were Matter of Danger‚ if you did
not officioussy interest yourself in the Affairs of others 3 but it
happens in Contradiction to this Scheme, that you, by your
being busy, over—busy, and the Republic by her total Inaffivsty,
are both involved in the greatest Dangers. “ But, by the *Gods‚
“ your F ather's and your Grandfire's Glory hath descended to
“ you, which it were dissionourable in you to forfeit, while
“ nothing buta nameless Obscurity and Meanness harh been
“ transmitted to the Commonwealth by our Ancestors.’' Very
far otherwise the Reality of the Fa& 3 for your Faffler, if he
resembled you, was a Robber, but by our Republic, and our
Ancestoes, as all Mankind can witnesS, the Greeks were twice -

preserved from apparent and immediate Ruin. (1 2)
