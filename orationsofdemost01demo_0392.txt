However this Letter may appear in a 'Ma ηει- 01 tiz-nlring among Scholars,

Transsation, it 'is acknowledged in the
OriginaL aperfect Model of the St-yle
and Language of princes. Yet the Sen-
riments, even »n a Transsation‚ will ap-
pear not unworthy of the illustrioris W ri-
ter. Its peculiar Charafter confists in an
Expreffion clear, unaffef-sed and concise ·‚
{n a regular Expofition of Paos„ sus-
tained by Arguments naturally rising from
them, and urged. with the plain F orce of
Reason. We see this great Monarch sup-
preffing his Resentment, and preventing
it from breaking forth into injurious os
indecem Language‚ by a Consziousness
of his own Dignity Even his Irony is
rempered with Majesty. ‚

Oui· Commentators believe this Letter
was written by Aristotle3 nor is this Be-
hof, althorigh unsmpported by any histo-
risa] Proof, an Affiont to the Monardx,
who could employ such a Secretary. But
Aristode, perhaps, was not equal to such
a Tnssz sior-very different 'is the Style and

lfh iosorhcru ansi ᾳ rmces. That Philip
himself might be capable of writing it,
let the Mor-ivos, lately published by a
great Monarch in Justification of his
Conduft, be a sufficient Evidence. Sa
Maieste' declare, que les libertos du Corps
Germanique ne seront ensevelies qu'en un
meme tombeau avec la Pruffe. Sa.
Majeste ne s’ecarte de sa Moderation or-
dinaire, qo’ ἐι cause -qu’ elle cesse d’ etre

 

‘une Vettii, lors qu’ ils s’agit de defendre

son Indcpendance, sa Patrie, et sa Cou-

ronne.
It only remairis to inform the Eng—

lish Reader‚ that Philip, in the Originab

-speaks always in the singular Number,

although the Transsator, in Imitation of

‘the modern Style of princes, bath ven-

tured to speak in the plural. If this
Alteration should appear blameable, let
him, however, hope to be forgiven, as
it is really the greatest Boldness in his
Work.
