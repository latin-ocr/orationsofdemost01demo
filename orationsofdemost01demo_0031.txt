OF ANCIENT GREECE. xvii

nesah and shall only observo at present, that all other, the
wisest Legissators founded their Institutions upon the Manners
and natural Genius of their Fellow-Citizens‚ while Lycurgus,
not only violently opposed his own Genius to that of the Spar-
tam, but even to that of Nature itself. He confounded all our
Notices and Conceptions of right and wrong, of Vice and Vir-
tue. Encouragements to Theft were blended with a Spirit of
Justice3 the severest Slavery with the most unbounded Free-
dom‚ and Sentiments of most intemperate Excess, with those
of the most regular Moderation. All the Tendernefi'es of N a-
ture were preserved, without having either Child, Husband or
Father. Even Modesty was banished, while Chastity maintain-
ed its highest Purity. This great Lawgiver formed a powerful
City without any of the usual Means of Grandeur or Defence;
without Arts, Commerce, Money, or Walls. He infused a
Spirit of Ambition into the Hearts of its Inhabitants‚ without
the Ideas of extending their Dominions; and inspired them
with Courage, even to Enthufiasm, without indulging to the
Ardours of Viemry in Pursuit of their Enemies. Sparta was a
Camp, in which the Soldiers lived under the strietest Discipline
of civil Justice‚ and the Laws were obeyed‚ not asin other
Countries, from‘Motives of Terrour and of Punissnnent, but

with a paffionate Love and Veneration.

FRQM these apparent Contradifflons arose a System of pri-
vate and public VirtueS, most nearly approaching, of all hu-
Vot. I. c man
