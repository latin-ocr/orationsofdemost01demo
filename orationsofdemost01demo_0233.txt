Aristides, surnamed the Just, had a con-
siderable Share in the Victories of Mara-
thon and Salamis. He was Commander
in Chief at the Battle of Plataea, in
which Mardonius, the Perfian General,
was killed and his Army routed. Yet
however eminently distinguished for his
military Abilities, we should rather con-
sider him as a great Example of all civil
Virtues. His Zeal for the public Good
was totally difinterested3 the Motive of
all his Affions3 equally superior to the
Glory of Battles and W'iffitories, in his
military Charatfiter, as to Riches and
Power in his civil Administration. The
Firmness and Constancy, with which
he supported his Disgrace (for he was
banished by the prevailing Interest of
Themistocles) are a Testimony to the
Sincerity of his Virtue3 and his Death
confirms the general Opinion of his In-
tegrity, for he died so poor, that the
Public was obliged to pay the Expence
of his F uneral, and to portion his Daugh-

terS.
Nicias was joined with Demosthenes

in the Command of the Expedition
against Sicily, though decreed against his
Advice by the Party of Alcibiades, All
his Condust in that VVar bespeaks him
an able Commander; but his Speech to
his Army, when broken and routed‚ and
flying before the vietorious Syracufians,
while he himself was distreffed with Sick-
ness, and Age, and its InfirmitieS, is

Interests

the noblest Monument of his Worth. It
is filled with every Sentiment of Piety
towards the Gods; of Dependance on
their Providence; of Courage, and even
of Despair, that is capable of animating
a Soldier to his Duty. That a Man, so
excellently good, should suffer an igno-
minious Death‚ to which he was con—
demned by the Syracusians, was thought
a Reproach to the Gods themselves, and
even a sufficient Cause to doubt their
Being, or their Providence.

DemosttheneS, whom our Orator names
only by a Kind of Periphmfi5, ὁμώνυμον,
was a distinguished Commander in the
Peloponnefian War. He was joined with
Nicias in the supreme Command of the
Sicilian Expedition3 shared with him, at
first, in the Success of the wan at last,
in his Misfortunes and his Death.

The Charaeter of Pericles is one of
the most distinguished in ancient History.
After the Death of Aristides, and the
Banishrnent of Themistocles, he engag-
ed in the Administration, for before that
Time he had prudently avoided all civil
EmploymentS, and endeavoured to distin-
guiffi himself in the Army, by his Cou-
rage and his military Abilities. He won
the Favour of the People, at first, by

the usual Methods of Compliance and
Adulation. But he soon assumed an Air ’

of Dignity more natural to him. Sel-
dom appeared in Public; never at Alieni-

blies of Mirth, or at Entertainments,
