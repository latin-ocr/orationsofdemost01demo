OF ANCIENT GREECE. vii

Skill in War appears inconfiderable‚ and their Manners were

perfeetly barbarous.

SUCH was the State of Greece during the first Period of her
History, containing almost seven hundred Years. Yet in this
Period not F able only and Poetry‚ but even Philosophy after-
wards placed their golden Age. The Earth gave her Fruits
without Culture3 her Inhabitants, untaught by Precepts and
uncontrouled by Laws, enjoyed the Simplicity of their own

Hearts amidst the innocent Delights of Love, of dancing and
Mufic, while those Excesses of the Paffions‚ which fill the
Breast of Man with Misery‚ were totally unknown.

gination‚ and it would have certainly been a mortifying Refiec-
tion to this haughtiest People‚ that their Poverty was their Se-

curity from foreign Conquests, and the Barrenness of their Coun-
try the natural Cause of their first rude Skill in Arts and Me-

chanics. Indeed, it is almost impoffible to conceive such

Wretchedness, as could engage them to institute divine Honours
to the Persons, who taught thern to exchange the miserable
Food of Herbs for Aeonis, and that of Acorm for W'heat.

They were civilized and instrueted by other Nations. Phoeni-p
cia taught them Navigation‚ Commerce and the Use of Let-

ters‚ AEgypt establissied their civil Polity, improved their
