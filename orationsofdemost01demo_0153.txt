The‘ARGUMENT.

THE social War had continued three Years, with equal Vigour,
and equal Success‚ when the Athenians, alarmed with an Appre·

henfion of a Perfian Invafion‚ concluded a Peace with the Confederates,
and granted thern that Liberty‚ for which they had taken up Arms⁹
The Rhodians were afterwards unhappily divided by civil Diffentions.
The oligarchical Party‚ affisted by Artemisia, under the Direction and
Influence of Artaxerxes OchUS‚ had opprefled the democratical. The
People apply to the Athenians for Protestiom and the Recovery of their
ancient Constitution. Demosthenes supports their Cause with Argu-

ments drawn from the political Interests of, Athens 3 the general Senti-
ments of Liberty, and the Glory of forgiving those I-njuries„ which the
Rhodiam, during the War‚ had committed against the Republic.

This Oration was- spoken in the second Year of the hundred and se-
venth Olympiad‚ when our Author was thirty Years of Age.
