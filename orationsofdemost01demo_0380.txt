306 oRATroNS OF

and Inatff'civity you did not severely enough resent the Cond'ucli
os these Traytors, but suffered others to take Posseffion of Ho-

nours properly yours: Concerning other Particulars‚ it is not
of Importance to inquire at present, but whenever Philip is ac-
cidentally mentioned in our Debate8‚ a certain Orator immedi-·>
ate] y rises aud declares, “ The Affair becomes extremely serious ;
“ we should by no Means proclaim War.” Then instantly·
forms a» regular Comparison, “ How desireable a Bleffing is
“ Peaoel How difficult to maintain a numerous Body of
“ Forces l Some People defign to plunder your Treasuryssf
With other Aflertions, which the People receive as Truths in--
contestible‚ and important. But our*Orator ought not to per-
suade you to preserve this Peace inviolably‚ for you are already
firm in this Persuafion, but much rather this Macedonian, who
is actually this Moment committing Hostilities against us ;> for
if he were persuaded, it is apparent you have no Objections.
Nor certainly should we compute how burthensome what we
shall expend upon the public Safety‚ but what we shall suffer,
if we do not resolve to execute the Plan I propose 3 to prevent:
the Peculation os the public Money, and. find some Method of

preserving it, yet not neglect any Measure of general‘Utility.

NoR can I without Indignation observe‚ that exceeding Grief,

with which some of you resent the Diffipation of your F undS.
