206 ORATIONS OF

otis, you have decreed, upon these Hopes and PromiseS, this>
very Peuce to your Foster-ity. So powerfully wcre you impell-

ed to receive it.

v Bur whcrcsore do I mention these Circumstinees? Where-
‘fore desire these Persons may be summoned before you ? I wssl,
hy all the Gods, with perfect F reedom declare the T ruth, with-
out Artifice or Disguise. Not with Defign‚ that I, then in-
jured by their Calumny, may now equally be rewarded with
your Approbation 3 (1 1) nor yet to furniffi to them, who have
ever hated and opposed me, a new Pretence for again receiving

Presents from Philip 3 nor yet to indulge my own Garrulity 3 but
persuaded, as I am, that the Defigns, which Philip is even now

forming against you, will be productive of greater Calamities,

(11 ) 'Ome' ἵνα ἒις λοιδορίαν ἐμπεσών,
ἐμαυτῷ μὲν ἐξ i'ffx λόγον παῤ ἅμῗν ποι-
ήσω most unhappily translated by Wol-
fius, non ut in convicium delapsus efficiam
ut ego vicissim conviciis apud vos inceffar.

When our Orator opposed these
Promises, which the Ambafl'adors made

in Philip³s Name, he was treated with
Ohloquy and Inveffive. But he could

he no longer apprehensive of such
Treatment‚ since the Athenians were

now convinced of his Integrity and
Wisdom. Why then does he desire
these Ambaffadors may be summon-

than

ed? That as he had been injured by
their Invefflves, he might be now restor-
ed, in their Presence, to his good Fame
and Reputation. Yet this Reason for
summoning them he disclaims with a
kind of Modesty, which at once asserts
his Righe and yet declines putting it to
Proof. Λόγος here fignifies‚ as in the
best Auffiors, fama, rumor. The Pas-
sage is therefore thus transsated by Luc-
chesini, from whom this Note is taken,
eos non ideo vocari velim, ut qui olim
conviciis dehonestatus fui, aeque nunc
mihi a vobis famam conciliem.
