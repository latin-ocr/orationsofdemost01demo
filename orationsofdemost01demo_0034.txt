Vittories of Alexander, yet that Monarch and his Macedonians
instantl'y became Perfians, by affuming the Dress, Manners„
Customs of the Perfians, and especially by intermarrying with
them. His Succeffors were immediately confidered, not ets,v
Greciansz but as Kings of AEgypt, Syria, Phrygia, or Car&⁸
padocia..

THE Republics os Greeee therefore ssiould have only been

attentive to the Preservation of their Liberty, the proper Ob·
je& of all Republican COnfederaeies. From the Nature of
their Constituti0n‚ they ssiould* have disclaimed all Intention of
Conquests or extending their DominionS, and united in a dee-
sensive War alone, for which they· were better fitted by the

ssow Spirit, natural to their F orm of Government. They should
have maintained an Interest among the Provinces of Per-

fia3 been watchful over their civil Wars3 supported the Sa-
trapes in their Revoks, and harraffed the Sea-Coasts of Asia?
by frequent Descents, and* light IncurfiOns„ Totally to have
negledted all Affairs of the Continent, or ever to have engaged
their whole Force in Expeditions thither, even for the Preser÷

vation of their Colonie8‚ had been> an equal Errour in theii-

Politics.
