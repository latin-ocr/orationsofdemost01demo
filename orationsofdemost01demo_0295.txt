DEMOSTHENES. 221

ΑΜ». your Commanders, who have ever sailed from these
Ports (or I shall confess myself worthy of whatever Punishment
you please to inflict) have always received Contributions both
from the Chians and Erythraeans, indeed from every other Peo-

ple, capable of paying them, Ι mean the People of Afia.
These Contributions are more or less considerable, in Propor-

tion to the Number of Gallies they command, nor do the Peo-
ple pay them, in whatever Proportion‚ for nothing, (they are
not yet arrived at such a Degree of Simplicity) but to purchase
the Security of their Merchants 3 to prote& their Veffels from

Pyrates, and procure them a Convoy to their different Port's.

Yet

pas, doivent l’ apprendre 3 and by a late
English Translator‚ But it is uectffary to
explain to some of you, the Effe& of this
Behaviour.

By this ConstruCtion, which, although
alittle perplexed, it is confefl‘ed, is not
absolutely contrary to the Rules of
>Gramrnar² the Pronoun τὰυτα is made
the Nominative Case to δύναται. ThUS
our Author’s reasoning, and the sense
of the Context‚ of far greater Import—
ance than all Grammm· Rules, is wholly
perverted. He afferts ὅτι ἕψηται ποιεῖν
rim-oc, that Diopythes can support his
conduct, by the Customs and Usages
establiihed by other Commandcrs, and
he then enters into the Proof of his A ffel-
tion‚ walin-55· ἔστι πῶπατ’ ἐκπεπλέυκασ,

διο. All your Comnmndem, who have ever
sailed-from these ports, ὅτε. The Paffage
is well transsated, although perhaps a lit-
tle too diffusely‚ by Lucchefini. Haec
vero, quae facit, ne cuiquam in mentem
veniat cogitare, ab aliorum usu, & consue-

tudine abhorrere, video mihi nonnullos
vestrum edocendos esse.

In historical Proof of this Custom,
not Admirals only leviel these Contri
buton but thlies were fitted out by
privent penora, who supponet] them
selves by Py racy, and ›avaging the mamb,
or plundering the maritime Towns of

Afra. For, in Imi tit on of rhea ancie nt ’
