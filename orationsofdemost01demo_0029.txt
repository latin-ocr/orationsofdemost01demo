OF ANCIENT GREECE. xv

HowEVER, the Grecian Colonies very soon forgot their Origin,
and seldom appear to have acknowlcdgcd it, except when they
implored Proteffion against their Enemies, which was generally
granted rather in the Vansty, or perhaps the Magnanimity of
Liberty‚ than for any just, political Reason. Thus the Mother-
States were not only not enriched or strengthened by their Co-
lonies, but must have felt a senfible Weakness by the Loss of
such Numbers of their Inhabitants. That Weakness produced
a general Equality‚ which rendered them all incapable of any
formidable Attempt against the common Liberty‚ and thus con-
firmed the Authority of the Amphyctions.

ΒΗΤ a People‚ by Nature impetuous and insolent3 d'iffering
in their Genius and Manners, fond of Liberty even to an Ex—
travagance of abufing it, could ill endure to be controuled by
a Council, whose Power very soon began to confist in the Wis-
dom only, and Justice of its ¹Decrees. They wanted some
more immediate Controul 3 some invariable Rule, to which they
might apply upon all particular Occafions,. and which was able
in itself to resti-ain, animate, and give one uniform Tenour
to their Conduct. Such was that System of Laws, by which
Sparta maintained her Liberty above fix hundred Years, and

her great Lawgiver‚ Lycurgus, became in some Measure the Le-
gissator of Greece.
