original Enemies. (9) But now this Monarch is in perfect
Amity with all the People of Greece, yet least of all inclined
to an Aliiance with us, except we better regulate our Condue't
towards him. Then let us consider how numerous the Preten-
fionS, which are formed 011 every Side of us to the sole Dominion
of Greece, and that each separate State assumes to itself the
Rank of Pre-erninence, while they all mutually oppose‚ envy,
and distrust each other. Thus contrary to their Interest and their
Duty are the Argives divided, the Thebans, Corinthians, La-
cedaemonians, Arcadiam, and the People of Athens. But

of Evagoras, who had revolted from the
Persian, and usurped the greater Part of
the Kingdom of Cyprus.

Mr. Tourreil blames the Irnmorality
and Ingratitude of this Conduet, with a
Remark of much infipid Vivacsty, that
notin these Days alone must Morality be
filem‘, when Politics speak. The true
Morality of Politics in the Subjech is the

Preservation of Liberty3 and the Safety Ἴ

of the People‚ whom Providence hath-
committed to their Care, is the first Duty
of Princcs. They cannot know any bet-

ter, they should not acknowledge any Α
other Morals.
