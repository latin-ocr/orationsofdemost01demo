(21) The Word λῆρες, here rendered
quzedusts, is construed Tristes by all our
Transsators, without Exception. A very
considerable Difference‚ and to an Eng-
lish Reader irreconcileable. It is derived
’ from λίαν ῥεῖν, to flow with Violence and

Rapidity 3 from whence in its original
Meaning it probably fignified Aqm’dtffls,
and in a metapliorical Sense was applied*⁴

ral Sense- of our Author. Athens was
