Death of Philip and Alexander may appear, as we are now in-

of such Importance. Yet if not prudent, they were glorious

this excellent Man from a Prosecution of Venality and Corrup-
tion. He was condemned in a Fine of fifty Talents, and be-
ing unable to pay it, was thrown into Prison. Strong Proof of
his Integrity‚ that after thirty Years Continuance in the most
lucrative Employments of the Commonwealth‚ and sometimes
prefiding over the public F unds, he was unable to pay such a
Sum, even with the Addition of the twenty Talents he was

supposed to have received for his Perfidy. But the Story is in
