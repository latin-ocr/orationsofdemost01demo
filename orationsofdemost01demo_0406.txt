Peace with the Republic, but only deferred the War, is

now become universally apparent.

For when he ceded Halus

to the Pharsalians, and undertook the conclu& of the Phocaean
War3 (1) when forming Reasons, which never existed, and in-

venting Pretences most unjust, he desolated whole Thrace, in

very Fa& he then commenced Hostilities, and began that War,

which in his Letters he now hath openly proclaimed. But that

you neither ought to tremble at his Power‚ nor meet him with

Mr. Tourreil very handsomely defends
our Author against the Critics, who
blame the Repetitions‚ which the Reader
must perceive in the following Oration.
lt seerns, this great Man believed hirn-
self superior to all trivial CritICisms upon

(1) Και τα) περὶ φωκέας διῳκήσατο
Transsated by Wolfius, Et Phocense ne-
gotium confecit 3 yet διωκὲω never pro-
perly fignifies conficere, but administra-
re, instituere, decernere, or in another
Sense, habitare seorfim. Very different
are the Ideas of compleating the Ruin
of the PhocaeanS, and undertaking to
conduc't the War against thern. The
Paffage is thus translated by Lucchesmi,
Phocense bellum fibi arripuit admini-
strandum.
