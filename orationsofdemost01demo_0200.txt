ORATIONS OF

selling us of Potidaea and giving it to them, in open A& of Injustice

to us, his more ancient Allies ;(3) lastly‚ that he hath lately

entered into an Alliance with the Theffalians, by promising to -

cede Magnesia to them, and maintain ,for them the Phocaean

&Rs-«ir. (4)

Upon the whole, there is not a single People‚

who have ever confided in him, whom he hath not deceived,

sind impofing perpetually‚ with Artifices like these, upon the

Imprudence of those, who unhappily knew him not, has he

thus enlarged his DominionS.

As he hath therefore risen by

these Artifices (for each of his Allies believed he would per-
form somewhat for their particular Advantage) so by these Ar-

tifices shall he certainly be thrown precipitately from his Height,

since openly convieted of having acted, in every single Instance,

for his own Interest only.

(3) Τιὲς μὲν πρότερον συμμάχες ἡμᾶς.
There are some Doubts here, with Re-
gard to the Text, arising from the Chro-
riology of fads. At what Time the
Athenians can be supposed Philip’s πρό-
τερον συμμάχες is difficult to determine.
The Scholiast understands the Potidaeans,
and Wolfius proposes to read ἡμῶν, our
Allies, but, according to his own Ob-
jeftiom after Demosthenes had said, Ho-
τίδαιαν ἔσαν ἡμετέραν he could not justly
call the inhabitants συμμάχες ἡμῶν.

(ῃ &vberi Lycophron, the Pheraean,
found himself unable to support a War
ngainst the united Forces of Philip and

IN

the Thessaliam, he entered into an Al-
liance with the Phocaeans‚ who them—
selves extremely wanted his Affistance
against the Thebans. This was the War,
that Philip promised the Theffalians to
maintain. He was twice defeated, bur
in a third Battle gained a complete vic-
tory over the Phocaeam, and Lycophron
surrendered Pherae. Among his other
promises Philip engaged to reduce Mag-
nesm, then in the hands of Lycophron‚
and cede it παραδώσειν to the Thefl‘alians.
