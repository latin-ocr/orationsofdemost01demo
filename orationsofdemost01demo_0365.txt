happen, you resume your former Operations 3 you affemble tu-
multuoussy and most unprofitably, for impoffible with new-
raised Troops to execute any Thing of Importance. You must
maintain a constant, regular Force 3 provide F unds for its Sub-

fistence3 appoint Treasurers‚ and by all exa&est Methods ima-
ginable preserve the public Funds from Diffipation. Then let
your Treasurers be accountable for whatever Sums they have ex-

pended, and your General for his Condu& 3 neither leave this
General a Pretence for sailing to any other Coast, or prosecut-
ing any other Expedition, than in Obedience to your Orders.

ner, you {hall either compel Philip to an equitable Peace, and
to continue within the Bounds of his own Dominions, or fight

him upon equal Terms. Then, perhaps, O Men of Athens,

perhapS, as you now inquire how Philip is employed, and whiae,
ther he is marching, so ffiall he be solicitous to know whither
the Troops of Athens are destined, and where they shall open

the Campaign.
