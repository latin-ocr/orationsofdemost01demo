ORATIONS OF

fore have a powerful Force, and divided into two Parts. Such
are my Sentiments with Regard to the Succours.

WrTH Regard to the Supplies, You have, O Men of AthenS,
you certainly have military F unds superior to those of any other
Nation in the World, but you receive and dispose of them, ac-

’ cording to your Pleasure. (9) If you restore them to the Sol-

diery, you will have no farther Occafion for Supplies 3 if not,
some other Fund will be absolutely necessary, rather, indeed,

no other will be sufficient.

“ Do you, Demosthenes, then de-

“ eree these F unds to the Military.'’ Not Ι, by Jupiter. But

(9) VV'nen our Orator says the military
Funds of Athens were superior to those
of any other Nation, he can only mean,
they were considerably great·‚ or by the
EXPFCffiOss ’ὅσ-οι §clevi τῶν ἄλλων civ-9345-
πων we must understand, any other State
of Greece.

When the Athenians had concluded a
thirty Years Peace with the Lacedaemo-
nians, they resolved to lay up a thousand
Talents annually in their Treasury, and
decreed it should be punishable with Death
ever to employ this sacred F und to any
other Use, than to repulse an Enemy,
who invaded the Coasts of Attica. This
Law was observed with that F ervour,
which usually attends new Regulations.
But Pmczes, to make himself popular,
proposed, that in Times of Peace this
Fund should be distributed to the People,
to defray the Expences of the public lin

terrainments‚ and restored to the military
Chest in Time of War. 'The Proposal
was received and with it the Restriftion,
But as all Indulgences of this Kind sooner
or later degener-ate into Licentiousness,
Eubulus carried a Decree, by which ic
should be capital to propose averting these
Treasures from the purposes to which
they were destined by Pericles. In wile
Apprehenfion, therefore, of this Danger‚
our Orator disclaims all Intention of re-
pealing this Law, but he obliges the
People to draw this strong Conclufion
from his mentioning it, that an Army
must be raised, and that no other Fund

is sufficient to maintain it. Our CritiCs
applaud his Dexterity in avoiding the
l’unishment denounced by Eubulus, yet
by their unhappy Refinements on Words
make him capable of attempting an in-
significant and abje& Evafion. ’
