domestic Soldiery, your own Citizens, that you yourselves
may receive the just Rcward for defending your Country. Lct
your General have an absolute Command over hia Army3 (3)
yet that you never may be affe&ed by such Diffi-effes, as you
have lately experienced ; reserve to yourselves a Power of bring—

ing him to his Trial‚ and let it be your only Concernment to

know by whom he is prosecuted. Nothing farthcr.

WHAT good Effe& will arise from this Condu& ? First, your

Allies may continue faithful, not controuled by GarrisonS‚ but
engaged by the mutual Advantages of the War: next, your
Generals, not commanding a Body of Mercenaries only, shall
no longer harrass, and plunder your Friends‚ yet never behold
the Face of an Enemy, from whence all Emoluments of the

War are wholly their own, while Hatred and Calumny are the

to give their Generals an absolute Corn-
mand over their Troops, yet that the
szune Misfortunes may not happen again,
to prevent their committing‚ or to punish
their Irregularities by a severe, but im-
partial lnquiry into their Conducffi. Ac-
cording to this reasoning περιὲςιν should .
be rendered, ut hoc fibi solum servent fa-
ciendum Athenienses, not as Wolfius

translates it, quod hic s1t exitus totius ne-
gotii. The whole Paffage is thus trans—
lated by Lucchesxni. Hujusmotii autem
copias imperatoris judicio permittite, at
simul, ne quibus nuper calamitatibus af-
ficiamini, severum de imperatoribus ju—
dicium reddite, istamque unam totius rei
curam facite vobis reliquam, quis nempe
cujus hominis filius cui duci diem dicat,
nec quicquam ultra.. The learned Rea- ’
der will allow that the Expreffion ἑ δεῖνα
r& δεῖνος τᾶν δεῖνα could have very little
Grace in English. It was a F ormulary of
their Impeachments.
