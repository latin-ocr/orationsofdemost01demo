DEMOSTHENES. 97

while Mausolus lived, or since his Death, that it was unjust to
seize upon Cos and Rhodes, and several other Grecian Cities,
which the Persian, at that Time their Sovereign, ceded by
Treaty to the Grecians, and for whose Libcrty they supported
such numerous Dangers, and maintained, during that Period,
so many glorious Wars? But if, perchance, there were any,

who should thus argue both with the Byzantians and with Ar-
temifia, yet neither of them would be persuaded, as they ought

both in Reason and in Justice.

I REALLY esteem it most equitable to restore the Peoplc of
Rhodes to their Liberty, yet even were it unjust, I think, while
I behold the Conducst of other States, I should still advise you
to restore them. Wherefore? Because, were all other N ations, O
Men of Athens, zealoussy resolved to a& upon the general Prin-—
ciples of Justice, it would be dishonourable, that you alone
should refuse. But while every other People, to the utmost of
their Power, are ever ready to commit all possible Injuries, that
we alone should pretend the Justice of our Actions, by which we
receive no kind of Advantage, I really think is not Equity, but
Weakness. For I perceive all the other States of Greece main-
tain by Force what they possess3 of which I can mention a well ‚

⁴ known Instance.
