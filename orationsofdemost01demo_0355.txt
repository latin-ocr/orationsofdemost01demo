The ARGUMENT.

HE restless, insatiate Spirit of Philip, and the yet unawakened In-

dolence of the Athenians‚ are again the great Objeffoe of this Ora-
tion, as of all the Philippics and Olynthiacs. We must therefore expe&
a Repetition of the same sentiments, and Expreffions 3 yet the Subjeffi,
in general, is varied by their different Affangement, and the apparent
Neceffity of oppOfing Philip's Ambition is urged by other circumstances,
and enforced with new Arguments. More effe&ually to insure their Ven-
geance, our Orator advises the People to send an immediate Embassy to
the Perfian. He then exhorts them, under the tenderest Images of pa-
rental Affection and filial Duty‚ to unite in that Amity, so neceffary to
their common preservation. His Lightnings and his Thunders, accord-
ing to the Language os Antiquity, are darted at the Heads of Traytors 3
they are Objefis of his Ten-our, his Detestation and his Horrdur.

He pronounced this Oration a Year after the last, in the fourth of
the hundred and ninth Olympiad.
