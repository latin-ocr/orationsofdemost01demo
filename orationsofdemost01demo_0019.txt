Preservation of it is the sole Obje& of their Attention.

To these Reflexions upon their first Situation‚ let us add a
Zeal for Religion, and we' shall finish the Charaeoer of the
‘Athenians during this Period of their History. Cecrops, the
Founder of Athens, was an AEgypdan, and he probably car-
ried with him into Greece the Superstitions of his Country.
He dedicated his new City to Minerva, and by the fabulous
Contest between her and Neptune for the Honour of patroniz-
ing it, we may believe, that all the Inssuences of Religion were
employed in the Dedication. The Athenians now saw them-
selves colleeoed into one Body‚ and from thence conceived ει·
formidable Idea of their own Strength. They enjoyed the

Bleffings of Society 3 grew civilized in their Manners, and cul-
tivated the Arts and Sciences under a Spirit of Liberty bestrfit-

ed to improve them, while all the other Nations of Greece con«
tinued in their original Barbarism. From this Period, therefore,
we may date the high Ideas they ever afterwards entertained of-
their own superior Genius and Abilities‚ with that extravagant·
Opinion, which. they maintained with so much Obstinacy, that·
they were destined to be the future Conquerors of the W orld,

and that those Countries alone, where neither Corn, or VineS,..
or Olives grew, ssrould be the Boundaries of their Empire.
