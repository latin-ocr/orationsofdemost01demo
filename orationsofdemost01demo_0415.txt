DEMOSTHENES. 341

Body covered with Wounds‚ and that the Athenians‚ to whom
it is hereditary never to obey‚ but to be universally vi&orious ς

that these very Affienians, through Softness and Indolence of
Spirit,.ss10uld refigu these Monuments of the Virtues of their
AncestorS, and abandon the Interests of their Country.

THAT I may not tedioussy lengthen out this Discourse, 1
shall only repeat the Neceffity of our unanimoussy preparing for
War, and encouraging the rest of Greece by Afflons, not by
Words‚ to entet into an Alliance with υς.. For vain are all
Words, wherein Astions have no Share3 especially with Regard
t‘o this Republic‚ as we have the Reputation of excelling all

others in the Art and F acility of speaking.

End of the ORATon upon PHILIP’s Letter.
