The ARGUMENT.

HIS Oration may be justly called the last of the Philippics. The

Athenians had sent Succours to the Byzantines, whom Philip had
befieged. Alarmed at their Approach he raised the Siege and concluded
a Peace with them, and their Allies. Our Orator, ever w‘atehful for the
Safety of 'his Country‚ and looking back on Philip's past Conduet, his
repeated Violation of Treaties, his numberless Aets of Hostsssty, com«
mitted during the last seven Years Peaee, justly suspeets his present Sin-
cerity. However, in Decency to their new EngagementS, his Name is
not once mentioned in the following Oration. The Sentiments are such-
as an ardent Zeal for the Republic, and an Apprehenfion of some immi-
nent Danger might naturally inspire. They are supported by every Ar..
gument capable of animating a great and Wise Pe'ople to resent the In-
juries 01· Indignities, with which they are threatened, to render them-
selves formidable to an insolent‚ ambitious Enemy, and to recover the
Glory bequeathed to them. by their Ancestors.

This Oration, probably, was pronounced the latter End of the first
Year of the hundred and tenth olympiad.>
