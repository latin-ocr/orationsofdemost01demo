14. ORATIONSOF

cording to the Schedule of your Laud-Tam into twenty Parts.
Then let one T wentieth be given to each of your greater

Claffes, and by them be subdivided equally to each Order of
twelve Citizens. Let these twelve distribute, in their pecu-
liar Divifions‚ what they receive, and the Gallies‚ which every

Division is by Lot obliged to provide, let them be fitted out
immediately. Your Revenues therefore, your Gallies, the Per-

sons appointed to build and equip them, with the whole Ex-
’ pence of your Marine, in this Manner, I think, may be best
formed and maintained. But the Completion of my Scheme?

Whence will it arise ? I {hall inform you with Ease.

I PRoPosE, that your Generals appoint ten Dock-Yards, near
as pofiible to each other, and each of them capable of building
thirty Gallies. When they have prepared these Yards, let them as-
sign for each two principa] Claffes of our Citizens, and thirty Gal-
lies. Then determine by Lot what Tribe‚ and what Trierarchs
shall take Poffeffion of each, that there may be two Claffes of fixty
Citizens, thirty Gallies, and one Tribe affigned to every Yard.
Whatever Tribe shall by Lot take Poffeffion of any of these

Yards, let it be divided into three Parts, and your Ships in

the same Manner. Let these Thirds again be appointed by
Lot, that as one Tribe presides over one whole Yard, so may

every Third of that Tribe over a Third of your Shipping.
Thus
