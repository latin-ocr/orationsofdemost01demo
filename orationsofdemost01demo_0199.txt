Glory by Aelions honourable and just. But considering and

examining with my best Attention‚ I find, that when certain

of your Orators violently drove the Olynthian Ambaffadors

from this Affembly‚ where they proposed to confer with you

upon the Terms of an AHiance, Philip then first abused our Sim-

plicity by promising to restore Amphipolis to us, and execute,

some other Time, a secret Article of the Treaty coneluded be-

tween us, which was even then rumoured abroad : (2) that he

afterwards gained the Confidence of the Olynthians by dispos-

(2) Ka} τῷ θξυλλέμευόν ποτε τδ
οἷπᾶῥρητον ἐκεῖνο κατασκευάσειν. These
Woids, according to M r. Tourreil, will

⁸ admit of three different Construffions.

He hath chosen the first, cette conven-
tion si secrette alors, ὅτ maintenant s1
ebruite'e. In all these Construe‘tions our
learned and judicious critic hath joined
ποτὲ with θρυλλέμενοιν, when it seems
better to be consti-ned with κατασκευά-
σεψ, An Article which he pronmsed to
execute at some other Time. Aliquando
{aeta-batur, says NVolfius; an Errour, if
indeed an Ermur, in which he hath been
followed by all his Editors.

Whether Tourreil harh succeeded bet—
ter in the historica] Part of his Notes
upon this passage, the Reader must de-
termine. The Athenians‚ says Theo<
pompus, deputed Antiphon and Chari-
. demus their Ambaffadors to Philip. They
endeavoured to engage that Monarch to
favour their Pretenfions upon Amphipo-
lis, and promised in Recompence to make

seffing
him Master of Pydna. The Ambaffa-

dors did not mention this Negotiation to
the People‚ apprehenfive that the Pyd-
naeans might hear and resent it.

This Qotation labours under {ome
Difficulties. Did Philip openly promise
to cede Amphipolis, yet make it a secret
Article of the Negotiation ? What could
either Athens or Philip apprehend from
the Resentment of the Pydnaeans? Ul-
pian in his Notes upon Theopompus, says
the Athenians offered Pydna to Philip,
not in Exchange sor Amphipolis, but
Potidoea. As the whole is Matter of
Conjefture, we may as well believe, with.
Lucchefmi, this secret Article regarded
the Restoration of Thespia and Plataea,
and a promise of repreliing the Power
of the Thebans. These were favourite

vPoint33 of Importance to Athens, and

the Neceflity of keeping such a Treaty
secret, with Regard to the Thebans, ie
apparent.
